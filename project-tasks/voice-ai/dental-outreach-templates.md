## Cold Email Sequence (3-Part)

### Email 1 — Day 1: The Hook

**Subject Lines (A/B test these):**
- A: `[Dr. [Name]] — your front desk can't call 200 patients a week`
- B: `How [City] dental practices cut no-shows 40% without hiring`
- C: `Quick question about your appointment reminders`

---

**Body:**

> Hi [First Name],
> 
> No-shows are quietly costing [Practice Name] thousands every month — a single missed appointment is $200-400 out the door.
> 
> The problem isn't that patients forget. It's that manual reminder calls can't scale.
> 
> We built VoiceDesk for exactly this: an AI voice system that sounds exactly like your receptionist, calls every patient 24 hours before their appointment, and lets them confirm or reschedule right on the call — 24/7, zero staff time.
> 
> Most practices we work with cut no-shows 30–50% in the first 30 days.
> 
> If you have 10 minutes this week, I'd love to show you a quick demo — no pitch, just the tool running live.
> 
> [Your First Name]  
> VoiceDesk | voicedesk.io  
> [Phone]

**CTA:** Link to Calendly ("Book a 10-min demo")

### Email 2 — Day 7: The Social Proof

**Subject Lines:**
- A: `Re: [Practice Name] — one number that might change your mind`
- B: `What happened when [City] dentist tried our AI calls for 30 days`

---

**Body:**

> Hi [First Name],
> 
> Sent you a note last week about VoiceDesk — wanted to share one quick result.
> 
> Dr. [Anonymized] in [Similar City] was averaging 9 no-shows per week. After 30 days with VoiceDesk, that dropped to 4. At $250 per appointment, that's $6,500/month recovered — for a $199/month tool.
> 
> Their front desk stopped dreading Monday morning confirmation calls entirely.
> 
> I won't keep filling your inbox — but if you want to see exactly how it works for a practice your size, I've got 2 slots open this week.
> 
> [Book a 10-min demo → Calendly link]
> 
> Either way, no pressure.
> 
> [Your First Name]

**CTA:** Calendly link (same as Email 1)

### Email 3 — Day 14: The Last Reach

**Subject Lines:**

- B: `Closing the loop on VoiceDesk`

---

**Body:**

> Hi [First Name],
> 
> I've reached out a couple times about helping [Practice Name] automate appointment reminders. I'll leave you alone after this — just wanted to make one final offer.
> 
> We'll set up VoiceDesk in your practice completely free for 30 days. No credit card. No obligation. If you don't see a drop in no-shows, you don't pay — ever.
> 
> We're only accepting 5 more practices this month (keeping onboarding personal), so if this sounds interesting, reply here or grab a slot:
> 
> [Book free trial setup → Calendly link]

## Cold DM Scripts

### LinkedIn (Practice Owner / Office Manager)

**For: Practice Manager or Owner you find via LinkedIn**

> Hi [Name], came across [Practice Name] while researching top dental practices in [City]. 
> 
> Quick question — is managing appointment no-shows a headache for your team? We built an AI voice system that handles reminder calls automatically (sounds like your actual receptionist, not a robot).
> 
> Most practices cut no-shows 30-50% in the first month. Happy to show you a 10-min demo if you're curious — or no worries at all if not!

**Follow-up (3 days later if no reply):**

> Hey [Name] — just following up! I put together a short demo specific to dental practices if you'd like to see it. No sales pitch, just the tool running live. Worth 10 minutes if no-shows are costing you $1K+ a month. Let me know!

---

### Instagram / Facebook (For Practice Accounts)

**Find:** Dental practices with active Instagram accounts — DM their page

> Hey [Practice Name] team! 👋 
> 
> We work with dental practices to automate appointment reminder calls with AI voice — patients hear a voice that sounds just like your front desk, can confirm or reschedule instantly.
> 
> Practices we work with typically recover $3-8K/month just from no-show reduction.
> 
> Would love to show you a quick 10-min demo if you're open to it. DM back or grab a slot here: [Calendly link]

---

### Facebook Group DM

**Use in: Dental practice management groups (not as spam — only after adding value in comments)**

> Hey [Name], loved your comment about [topic they posted on]. We actually built a solution for exactly that — AI voice reminders that run on autopilot so your staff doesn't have to chase confirmations. Worth a 10-min demo? Happy to show you live.

---

## Voicemail Script

**Keep it under 30 seconds. Confident, friendly, no desperation.**

---

> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from VoiceDesk. I'm reaching out to a few dental practices in [City] about a tool we built that automates appointment reminder calls using AI — most practices cut no-shows by 30-50% in the first month. 
> 
> I'd love to show you a quick 10-minute demo if you're open to it. My number is [Phone] — give me a call back, or visit VoiceDesk.io to book a time that works for you. 
> 
> Thanks, [Name], talk soon."

---

**Cold call opener (if they pick up):**

> "Hi [Name], this is [Your] from VoiceDesk — I'll be super brief. We help dental practices automate their appointment reminder calls using AI voice, so patients hear something that sounds like your actual receptionist, not a recording. Most practices see a 30-50% drop in no-shows in the first month. I was wondering — is that something your team is dealing with right now, or have you got it handled?"

*(Then just LISTEN. Let them respond. Don't pitch further until they've spoken.)*

---

## Objection Handler Quick-Sheet

### "We already send text reminders."

> "Text reminders are great for patients who respond to texts — but studies show voice calls have 3-4x higher confirmation rates. VoiceDesk does both: it calls first, then sends an SMS if the call goes unanswered. So you're not replacing your texts — you're backing them up with something that actually gets a response. Want to see how that works in the demo?"

---

### "We have a receptionist who handles that."

> "Totally makes sense — and VoiceDesk isn't meant to replace them. It's meant to free them up from the part that's most tedious: the 20-30 reminder calls every Monday. Once VoiceDesk handles that automatically, your front desk can focus on patients who are actually in the office. Most practices say their staff love it within a week."

---

### "We're not big enough to need this."

> "Actually, that's where it pays off the most. Smaller practices feel every single no-show — one cancellation on a Friday afternoon can't be backfilled. VoiceDesk starts at $99/month. If it saves you even one no-show per month, it's already paid for itself twice over. We can do a free 30-day trial so there's zero risk."

---

### "I don't want patients hearing an AI voice."

> "That's a fair concern — and it's why we use voice cloning. VoiceDesk can clone your receptionist's actual voice, so the patient hears someone familiar. We've had patients tell practices 'thanks for calling personally.' They genuinely can't tell. I can play you a sample on the demo call."

---

### "Sounds great but the timing isn't right."

> "I hear you — practice life is non-stop. Can I ask what would need to change for this to be worth exploring? If it's budget, we have a free 30-day trial. If it's bandwidth, setup takes less than an hour and we handle it for you. I just want to make sure the timing actually lines up when you're ready."

---

### "We tried something like this before and it didn't work."

> "I'm sorry to hear that — what went wrong? [Let them answer.] ... That's helpful. A lot of our clients came from bad experiences with generic reminder tools. The difference with VoiceDesk is [address specific thing they mentioned]. Happy to show you exactly how we handle that on a demo."

---

### "What does it cost?"

> "Plans start at $99/month for smaller practices and go up to $349 for multi-dentist offices with full automation. There's also a free 30-day trial — no credit card needed — so you can see the no-show impact before you spend anything. What does your appointment volume look like roughly? I can point you to the right fit."

---

### "We're a HIPAA-covered entity. Is this compliant?"

> "Yes, specifically. VoiceDesk runs on ElevenLabs (ISO 27001 certified) and Twilio (HIPAA-eligible). We don't store patient PHI on our end — only anonymized call logs. We also provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) as part of the setup. Your compliance team will be comfortable with this."

---

### "I need to talk to my partner/office manager first."

> "Of course — that makes total sense. Would it be helpful if I sent over a one-page overview you could share with them? I can also do a 15-minute demo with both of you together, whatever's easier. When do you think you'd have a chance to loop them in?"

---
