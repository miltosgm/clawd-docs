**Created:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Miltos  
**Platform:** ElevenLabs  
**Target:** Independent US dental practices

## 1. Company Name Options

| Option | Positioning | Domain Availability |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **VoiceDesk** | Clean, professional — "your AI front desk" | voicedesk.io |
| **RecallAI** | Callback/recall pun + patient recall campaigns | recallai.co |
| **DentVoice** | Niche-specific, instantly clear to dental buyers | dentvoice.com |

**Recommendation:** **VoiceDesk** — industry-agnostic enough to expand beyond dental later, professional, memorable. Tagline: *Your 24/7 AI Receptionist for Dental Practices.*

---

## 2. Positioning

### Who We Are
VoiceDesk automates patient communication for dental practices — appointment reminders, no-show recovery calls, and follow-ups — using AI voice technology so natural patients can't tell it's not your receptionist.

### Target Customer
- **Primary:** Independent dental practices, 1-5 dentists, US market
- **Secondary:** Small group practices (5-15 chairs), orthodontics, pediatric dentistry
- **Not yet:** DSOs (Dental Support Organizations), hospital groups — too complex to close initially

### Core Value Proposition
> "Stop losing $300 every time a patient no-shows. VoiceDesk calls them for you, 24/7, with a voice that sounds exactly like your front desk."

### Why Dental Practices Buy
1. **Financial pain is quantifiable** — a missed appointment = $150-400 lost revenue
2. **Staff is stretched** — receptionists have no time to chase no-shows
3. **Existing services are expensive** — answering services cost $300-500/mo
4. **Simple outcome** — "reduce no-shows" is easy to sell and measure

## 5. Competitive Moat — Why They Pick Us Over DIY ElevenLabs

| Factor | DIY ElevenLabs | VoiceDesk |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Setup time | 2-4 weeks of dev work | 5 minutes self-service |
| Technical skill needed | Developer required | Zero coding |
| Integration with dental software | Build from scratch | Pre-built webhooks |
| HIPAA compliance setup | DIY research + legal | Handled, BAA included |
| Call delivery (Twilio) | Separate account to set up | Included |
| 2-way IVR (confirm/reschedule) | Complex build | Built-in |
| Templates for dental | None — start from zero | 10+ dental-specific scripts |
| Ongoing maintenance | Your problem | We handle it |
| Support | ElevenLabs generic support | Dental-focused support |

**The moat in one sentence:** We are the layer between a raw API and a dental practice — they buy time, not technology.

### Secondary Moats (Build Over Time)
- **Integrations** — once embedded in Dentrix/Open Dental, switching cost is high
- **Voice data** — practices that clone their receptionist's voice are locked in
- **Social proof** — "X practices trust VoiceDesk" becomes a signal to buyers
- **Niche credibility** — dental associations, referral networks, dental-specific marketing

## 6. Month 1–3 Action Plan

### Month 1: Land First 3 Clients

**Week 1: Prep**
- [ ] Set up ElevenLabs Pro ($82/mo) + Twilio account ($20 credit to start)
- [ ] Record 1 demo voice from voice-ai-demo.html (already built)
- [ ] Create Google Sheet to track calls made, responses, demos booked
- [ ] Set up Calendly for "Free Demo" booking
- [ ] Deploy landing page (voice-ai-landing-page.html — already built)
- [ ] Register domain (voicedesk.io or recallai.co)

**Week 2–3: Outreach**  
*Target: Independent dental practices, Google Maps + Yelp search*

**Who to call:**
- Solo/small group practices (1-3 dentists)
- Practices with Google Reviews mentioning "hard to reach" or "reminder issues"
- Practices that still use answering machines (easy signal)
- Practices in suburban/semi-rural areas (less staff, more need)

**How to find them:**
1. Google Maps: "dentist near [city]" → filter by size (no chain brands)
2. Yelp: filter for 3-4 star dentists (they have room to improve)
3. LinkedIn: "dental practice manager" in [metro area]
4. State dental association member directories

**Outreach sequence:**
1. Cold email (use dental-outreach-templates.md) → Day 1
2. Cold call or voicemail → Day 3
3. Follow-up email → Day 7
4. LinkedIn DM → Day 10

**Week 4: Close**
- Goal: 3 practices on free 30-day trial
- Frame: "We'll set it up for free, you measure the no-show impact, pay only if it helps"
- Document: baseline no-show rate before starting, track daily

### Month 2: Convert Trials + Get Referrals

**Goals:**
- Convert 2 of 3 trials to paid (Growth tier)
- Collect 1 written testimonial + 1 ROI number
- Book 10 more demos from outreach

**Actions:**
- Weekly check-in with trial clients (5-min call, Thursday)
- Build "no-show report" for each practice to show data
- Ask for referrals after first win: "Do you know other dentists who'd want this?"
- Post results to LinkedIn (anonymized case study)
- Refine scripts based on what patients are actually saying

**Who to call in Month 2:**
- Dentists who follow dental equipment/practice management groups on LinkedIn
- Practices that advertise on Facebook (they're growth-minded)
- New dental practices (first 2 years of operation — desperate for automation)

### Month 3: Build Repeatability

**Goals:**
- 10 total paying clients
- $1,500+ MRR
- 1 referral partnership (dental consultant, dental coach, or Dentrix reseller)

**Actions:**
- Start Facebook/Instagram ads: $300/mo budget, test 2 creatives
- Write 1 blog post: "How [Practice Name] Reduced No-Shows 45% in 30 Days"
- Join 1 dental Facebook group (share knowledge, not spam)
- Reach out to 3 dental consultants about referral commissions (15-20% first year)
- Set up basic Stripe billing + automated onboarding email sequence

### Closing Script (Phone/Demo Call)

> "Dr. [Name], right now your front desk is spending maybe 2 hours a week chasing no-shows and confirmations. VoiceDesk does all of that automatically — your patients hear a voice that sounds exactly like your receptionist, they can confirm or reschedule right then. Most practices cut no-shows 30-50% in the first month. We set everything up for you, there's no contract, and the first month is free. Can I show you a 10-minute demo this week?"
