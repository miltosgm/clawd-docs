## Notes

- **Timing:** 8-9 AM Athens = 6-7 AM UTC = good for US + EU overlap
- **Frequency:** Daily posts = visibility + consistency signal to algorithm
- **Voice:** All posts are in Miltos's authentic voice (not corporate)
- **Quality:** Substance over frequency (one great post > three mediocre)
- **Engagement:** The CTA at end of each post drives comments
- **ROI:** Track followers + inbound inquiries to measure impact

**Goal:** Establish Miltos as the top voice on AEO + growth marketing in his network, drive inbound leads via LinkedIn presence.
