# Growth Strategy Proposal for Renouveau Capital

**Prepared for:** Renouveau Capital Group  
**Prepared by:** Miltos George | Growth-onomics  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Goal:** €10M AUM from HNWI & semi-professional investors (€10K+ minimum)

---

## The Challenge

You're targeting sophisticated investors who:
- Research extensively before committing capital
- Value track records over marketing claims
- Expect institutional-grade transparency
- Won't respond to traditional lead-gen tactics

**The problem:** Most performance marketing approaches are built for B2C or low-ticket B2B. HNWIs operate differently. They don't click ads promising "10X returns." They look for credibility signals, verifiable track records, and educational content that demonstrates expertise.

**Your edge:** Systematic, data-validated strategies with tight downside control. That's a story worth telling—but it needs to be told *where* and *how* sophisticated investors actually research.

---

## Our Approach: Trust-First, Performance-Second

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Build the credibility infrastructure before scaling acquisition**

#### 1. Investment Thesis Content Hub
Create a content library that answers every question a sophisticated investor asks *before* they book a call:

- **"Why Systematic Over Discretionary?"** — Blog post explaining your edge
- **"Downside Protection in Volatile Markets"** — White paper on risk management
- **"Understanding Our Performance Metrics"** — Transparent explainer (Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown)
- **"What €10K Gets You"** — Clear expectations on allocation, liquidity, reporting

**Why this matters:** HNWIs don't convert on a sales page. They convert after consuming 6-8 pieces of educational content. We build that library.

#### 2. LinkedIn Thought Leadership (You or Your Founder)
Position a key spokesperson as *the* voice on systematic investing in precious metals/currencies.

**Posting cadence:** 3x/week
- Market commentary (data-driven, no hype)
- Risk management insights
- Transparency posts ("Here's what we got wrong last quarter")

**Target:** 5,000 followers in 90 days → qualified investor pipeline

#### 3. SEO for Investor Research Queries
HNWIs Google before they invest. We own the search results.

**Target keywords:**
- "Systematic precious metals fund EU"
- "Low volatility currency strategies"
- "€10K minimum hedge fund alternatives"
- "Regulated alternative investments Europe"

**Goal:** 1,000+ monthly organic visitors (high-intent)

---

### Phase 2: Acquisition (Weeks 5-12)
**Once credibility is built, activate paid acquisition**

#### 4. LinkedIn Ads (Primary Channel)
Target decision-makers by title, income, interests:
- **Job titles:** Portfolio Manager, Investment Director, Private Wealth Manager, Family Office Analyst
- **Interests:** Alternative investments, quantitative trading, risk management
- **Geography:** EU-focused (Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland as Tier 1)

**Ad format:** Lead gen forms (no external landing pages—keep friction low)

**Offer:** "2024 Performance Report + Risk Framework" (gated asset)

**Budget:** €3K-5K/month → 50-80 qualified leads/month

#### 5. Google Search Ads (Secondary Channel)
Capture bottom-funnel intent:
- "Invest in systematic trading fund"
- "EU regulated precious metals fund"
- "Low-risk currency investment"

**Budget:** €2K/month → 20-30 high-intent leads/month

#### 6. Retargeting (Close the Loop)
90% of visitors won't convert on first visit. We follow them with:
- Video testimonials (if available)
- Performance snapshots (compliance-friendly)
- Educational content ("3 Questions to Ask Any Fund Manager")

---

### Phase 3: Conversion & Nurture (Ongoing)
**Turn leads into €10K+ investors**

#### 7. Email Nurture Sequence
**Week 1-2:** Education (risk management, systematic advantages)  
**Week 3:** Social proof (case study or investor testimonial)  
**Week 4:** Performance transparency (audited reports, fxblue links)  
**Week 5:** Call-to-action (schedule introduction meeting)

**Open rates:** 35-45% (finance content)  
**Meeting booking rate:** 8-12% of engaged leads

#### 8. Webinar Series (Optional Advanced Tactic)
Host quarterly webinars:
- "Market Outlook: Precious Metals in 2026"
- "How Systematic Strategies Protect Capital in Downturns"

**Benefit:** Position as educator, not salesperson. HNWIs attend, engage, invest.

---

## Compliance-First Approach

We understand you're targeting retail investors in the EU through CTM's pooled structure. Every piece of content will:
- Avoid unverified performance claims
- Include risk disclaimers
- Comply with MiFID II and UCITS marketing rules
- Get your legal sign-off before publishing

**No hype. No promises. Just data-driven positioning.**

## Expected Outcomes (90 Days)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Website Traffic** | 2,000+/month | Organic + paid |
| **Qualified Leads** | 100-150 | HNWIs, semi-professional investors |
| **Booked Meetings** | 10-15 | 8-12% conversion from engaged leads |
| **New AUM** | €300K-500K | Assumes 2-3 investors close (€100K-200K avg) |
| **LinkedIn Followers** | 5,000+ | Thought leadership account |

**12-Month Projection:** €2M-3M AUM from digital channels (contributing 20-30% of your €10M goal)

## Why Growth-onomics?

1. **We speak finance.** I've worked with regulated financial services brands. I understand compliance, investor psychology, and the long sales cycle.

2. **Performance marketing, not brand fluff.** Every euro spent is tracked. Every tactic is measured. If something doesn't drive qualified leads, we kill it.

3. **LinkedIn expertise.** I have 16,700+ followers and understand how to build credibility with sophisticated audiences. Your founder/spokesperson will learn the playbook.

4. **AEO & AI search.** While competitors focus on Google, we're positioning you for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini—where investors increasingly start research. (This is a 12-18 month advantage window before your competitors catch on.)

## One Final Thought

Most fund managers wait until they have a "perfect" track record to start marketing. By then, competitors have already built trust with your ideal investors.

You have audited reports starting February. You have fxblue data. You have a compelling story (systematic + downside control).

**The question isn't whether you're ready to market. It's whether you're ready to own the narrative before someone else does.**

Let's build this pipeline.
