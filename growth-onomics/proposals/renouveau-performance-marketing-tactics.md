### Campaign 2: "Anti-Hype Positioning"
**Objective:** Differentiation from competitors  
**Target:** Sophisticated investors tired of unrealistic promises  
**Budget:** €1,500/month

**Ad Example 2A: Text-Heavy Thought Leadership**
```
[HEADLINE]
"We used to deliver 200%+ annual returns. Here's why we don't anymore."

[BODY]
Transparency moment:

Our first 22 months delivered 214% CAGR.
That's exceptional. It's also not sustainable.

Here's what changed:
→ AUM growth (execution constraints)
→ Market regime shifts (gold volatility normalized)
→ Risk prioritization (capital preservation > peak returns)

Our target going forward: 30-40% annually.

Why are we telling you this?

Because sophisticated investors deserve honest expectations, 
not marketing hype.

- Arrow pointing to "30-40% Target (2026+)"
- Text overlay: "Honesty > Hype"
- Professional, muted colors (grey/blue)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Contrarian to typical fund marketing
- Builds trust through vulnerability
- Attracts rational, long-term investors
- Filters out return-chasers

**Expected Performance:**
- CTR: 2.0-2.5% (contrarian angle drives engagement)
- Cost per lead: €35-50
- Monthly leads: 30-43

---

### Campaign 3: "Risk Management Focus"
**Objective:** Attract capital-preservation minded investors  
**Target:** Investors burned by high-drawdown strategies  
**Budget:** €1,500/month

**Ad Example 3A: Problem/Solution Format**
```
[HEADLINE]
"Your hedge fund had a -23% month. Ours? -0.49%."

[BODY]
Maximum drawdown in 22 months: 6.11%
Worst single month: -0.49% (September 2025)

How we protect capital:
→ Intraday systematic exits (no overnight risk)
→ Multi-layer risk controls (position sizing + volatility limits)
→ 2-3 hour average holding period (limits exposure)

95.45% monthly win rate isn't luck.
It's disciplined risk management.

## Email Campaign Concepts

### Email Sequence 1: "Rational Investor Nurture"
**Trigger:** Downloaded performance report

**Email 1 (Immediate):** Report delivery + methodology explainer
```
Subject: Your Renouveau Performance Report (+ what Sharpe 7 means)

Hi [Name],

Here's your full performance report (attached).

Quick context on one number: Sharpe Ratio of 7.

Most funds target >2. Institutional gold standard is 3-4.
So what does 7 mean?

It means we generated 7 units of return for every 1 unit of risk.
Over 22 months. Through 509 trades. Systematically.

Not luck. Not market timing. Disciplined execution.

Read the full methodology on page 4 of the report.

Questions? Hit reply.

Best,
[PM Name]
Renouveau Capital
```

**Email 2 (Day 3):** Risk management deep-dive
```
Subject: How we kept drawdown under 7% (even in September 2025)

[Name],

September 2025 was our worst month: -0.49%.

Here's what happened:
→ Gold volatility collapsed (our primary market)
→ Our system reduced position sizes automatically
→ We took 47 trades vs. usual 55-60
→ Win rate dropped to 42% (vs. average 45%)

Result: -0.49% drawdown instead of potential -8-12%.

This is what systematic risk management looks like.

Want to see the full framework?

[PM Name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7):** Transparency positioning
```
Subject: Why we tell investors about our -0.49% month

Most funds hide losses.

We highlight them.

Here's why:

1. Transparency builds trust (you deserve honest expectations)
2. Risk management matters more than peak returns
3. Drawdowns are inevitable (how we handle them isn't)

Our worst month: -0.49%
Our max drawdown (22 months): 6.11%

Compare that to your current allocations.

## Lookalike Audience Strategy

### Audience 1: "Performance Report Downloaders"
**Source:** Email list of report downloaders  
**Size:** Start with 500+ emails  
**Campaign:** Same as cold acquisition, but adjusted messaging

**Why This Works:**
- LinkedIn/Facebook find similar profiles
- Higher conversion rate (20-30% lift)
- Lower cost per lead (15-25% reduction)

**Scaling Plan:**
- Month 1-2: Build seed audience (target: 500+ leads)
- Month 3: Create lookalike (1% similarity)
- Month 4+: Scale lookalike campaigns

---

## Content Amplification Strategy

### Tactic: LinkedIn Thought Leadership Ads
**Objective:** Build authority, generate organic engagement  
**Budget:** €500/month

**Example Post to Amplify:**
```
[ORGANIC POST FROM FOUNDER]
"We had our worst month in September 2025: -0.49%.

Here's what I learned about risk management:

[Detailed breakdown of what happened]

This is what separates systematic execution from luck."

[BOOST POST AS AD]
Target: Quantitative traders, portfolio managers, wealth advisors
CTA: "Follow for transparent market insights"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Organic engagement signals quality to algorithm
- Builds follower base (5,000+ in 90 days)
- Establishes thought leadership
- Creates retargeting audience

**Expected Performance:**
- Engagement rate: 4-6% (thought leadership content)
- Cost per follower: €0.80-1.20
- Long-term value: Organic reach on future posts

---

## A/B Testing Plan

### Test 1: Trust Signal Hierarchy
**Variable:** What credibility signal converts best?

**Version A:** Lead with Sharpe Ratio (7)
**Version B:** Lead with Win Rate (95.45%)
**Version C:** Lead with Drawdown Control (6.11% max)
**Version D:** Lead with Transparency ("Here's our worst month")

**Method:**
- Split traffic 25% each
- Run 2 weeks minimum (50+ conversions per variant)
- Winner gets 100% traffic

**Hypothesis:** Drawdown control (Version C) will win with risk-averse HNWIs

---

### Test 2: Call-to-Action
**Variable:** What action drives most qualified leads?

**Version A:** "Download Performance Report"
**Version B:** "Schedule 15-Min Call"
**Version C:** "Get Free Risk Assessment"
**Version D:** "Join Investor Waitlist"

**Hypothesis:** "Schedule 15-Min Call" (Version B) drives most qualified leads (even if volume is lower)

---

### Test 3: Landing Page Length
**Variable:** How much information before asking for conversion?

**Version A:** Short (3 key metrics + form)
**Version B:** Medium (metrics + methodology + FAQ + form)
**Version C:** Long (full factsheet content + testimonials + form)

**Hypothesis:** Medium length (Version B) balances information with friction
