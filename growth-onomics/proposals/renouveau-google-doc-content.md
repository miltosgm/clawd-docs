# Renouveau Capital - Complete Growth Strategy Proposal
**Performance Marketing to Achieve €10M AUM**

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Client:** Renouveau Capital Group  
**Prepared by:** Miltos George | Growth-onomics  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Goal:** €10M AUM from HNWI & semi-professional investors (€10K+ minimum)

**Your Numbers (22 months track record):**
- Sharpe Ratio: **7** (institutional funds dream of >2)
- Monthly Win Rate: **95.45%** (21/22 months profitable)
- Maximum Drawdown: **6.11%**
- Calmar Ratio: **35**
- Worst Month: **-0.49%** (September 2025)
- CAGR: **214%** (2024)

**90-Day Targets:**
- 120-160 qualified leads
- 12-20 introduction calls
- €400K-700K new AUM

**12-Month Projection:**
- €2.5M-4M new AUM (25-40% of €10M goal)

## 📈 Why Your Track Record Deserves Better Marketing

**The opportunity:** You have exceptional performance data that most funds take 5+ years to build. But investors searching for "systematic trading funds" are finding competitors with weaker track records but stronger digital presence.

**The disconnect:** Right now, HNWIs researching alternative investments don't know you exist. They're allocating capital to funds with Sharpe Ratios of 1.5-2 simply because those funds show up first in search results.

**The solution:** Build a trust-first digital acquisition engine that amplifies your transparency as a competitive advantage.

## 🎯 Our Approach: Transparency at Scale

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
Build credibility infrastructure before scaling acquisition

#### 1. Investment Thesis Content Hub
Create educational content that answers every investor question before they book a call.

**Content pieces we'll create:**
- "Why a 44.79% Win Rate Beats 80%+ Promises" (Blog post explaining your risk/reward approach)
- "Sharpe 7, Calmar 35: What These Numbers Actually Mean" (Risk metrics explainer white paper)
- "From 200%+ to 30-40%: Why We're Transparent About Future Expectations" (Trust-building transparency)
- "Inside Our Intraday Systematic Approach" (Methodology breakdown)
- "What €10K Gets You at Renouveau" (Clear investor expectations)

**Why this works:** HNWIs consume 6-8 pieces of content before making allocation decisions. We give them that education journey.

#### 2. LinkedIn Thought Leadership
Position your founder/PM as the voice of rational systematic investing.

**Posting strategy:**
- **Frequency:** 3x/week (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday)
- **Themes:** Transparency wins, risk education, market commentary, investor education
- **Target:** 5,000+ followers in 90 days
- **Content training:** I'll teach your team the exact playbook that built my 16,700 followers

**Example post topics:**
- "Here's our worst month (-0.49%). Here's what we learned."
- "Why maximum drawdown matters more than peak returns"
- "5 questions to ask any systematic fund before investing"

#### 3. SEO for Bottom-Funnel Investors
Own the search results where sophisticated investors research.

**Target keywords:**
- "Systematic precious metals fund EU regulated"
- "Intraday trading fund low drawdown"
- "Alternative investment €10K minimum"
- "Sharpe ratio 7 investment fund"

**Goal:** 1,500+ monthly organic visitors (high-intent, research-stage)

---

### Phase 2: Acquisition (Weeks 5-12)
Activate paid acquisition once credibility is established

## 🧪 A/B Testing Plan

### Test 1: Trust Signal Hierarchy
**What we're testing:** Which credibility signal converts best?

| Variant | Lead Metric | Hypothesis |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **A: Sharpe Ratio** | Lead with "Sharpe 7" | Appeals to sophisticated quant investors |
| **B: Win Rate** | Lead with "95.45% monthly" | More accessible, emotionally compelling |
| **C: Drawdown** | Lead with "6.11% max DD" | Resonates with risk-averse HNWIs |
| **D: Transparency** | Lead with "Here's our worst month" | Builds trust through vulnerability |

**Method:**
- Split traffic 25% each
- Run 2 weeks minimum (50+ conversions per variant)
- Winner gets 100% traffic

**Our prediction:** Variant C (Drawdown control) will win with risk-averse HNWIs

---

### Test 2: Call-to-Action
**What we're testing:** Which action drives most qualified leads?

| Variant | CTA | Expected Impact |
|---------|-----|-----------------|
| **A** | "Download Performance Report" | Highest volume, lower qualification |
| **B** | "Schedule 15-Min Call" | Lower volume, highest qualification |
| **C** | "Get Free Risk Assessment" | Value-add positioning |
| **D** | "Join Investor Waitlist" | Scarcity/exclusivity angle |

**Our prediction:** Variant B drives most qualified leads (even if absolute volume is lower)

---

### Test 3: Landing Page Length
**What we're testing:** How much information before asking for conversion?

| Variant | Design | Pros/Cons |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **A: Short** | 3 metrics + form | Low friction, may lack trust signals |
| **B: Medium** | Metrics + methodology + FAQ + form | Balanced information/friction |
| **C: Long** | Full factsheet + testimonials + form | Maximum trust, higher friction |

**Our prediction:** Variant B (Medium) balances information with conversion

## 🤝 Why Growth-onomics?

### 1. We Speak Finance
I've worked with regulated financial services brands. I understand:
- Long sales cycles (6-12 weeks is normal for HNWI allocations)
- Compliance constraints (MiFID II, UCITS, cross-border rules)
- Investor psychology (risk-averse, research-heavy, peer-influenced)

This isn't my first systematic fund. I know what works.

### 2. Performance Marketing, Not Brand Fluff
Every euro spent is tracked. Every tactic is measured.

**Example decision-making:**
- If LinkedIn ads cost €80/lead but Google is €50/lead → shift budget to Google
- If "Sharpe 7" creative converts 2x better than "Win Rate" → kill the loser, scale the winner
- If email open rates drop below 30% → rewrite subject lines

No ego. Just ROI.

### 3. LinkedIn Expertise
I have 16,700+ followers in finance/marketing. I know how to build credibility with sophisticated audiences.

Your founder/spokesperson will learn the exact playbook:
- What content themes resonate
- Optimal posting frequency
- Engagement tactics that work
- How to turn followers into leads

### 4. AEO & AI Search Advantage
While competitors focus only on Google, we're positioning you for:
- **ChatGPT** (100M+ searches/day)
- **Perplexity AI** (fastest-growing search engine)
- **Gemini** (Google's AI search)

**Why this matters now:**  
Sophisticated investors increasingly start research with AI. We optimize for these platforms TODAY (12-18 month window before competitors catch on).

**Example scenario:**
```
Investor asks ChatGPT:
"What are the best systematic precious metals funds in Europe 
with low drawdown?"

Right now: You probably don't show up.
In 90 days: You will.
```

This is the AEO advantage. Early movers dominate AI search results.

## 🔥 One Final Thought

You have a 22-month track record that most funds take 5+ years to build.

You have a **Sharpe Ratio of 7** (institutional investors dream about Sharpe >2).

You have transparent, **audited performance data** starting February.

**The question isn't whether you're ready to scale AUM.**

**It's whether you're ready to compete for attention in a crowded market.**

Right now, investors searching for systematic funds are finding competitors with weaker track records but stronger digital presence.

They're allocating capital to funds with **Sharpe Ratios of 1.5-2**, simply because those funds show up first in search results and have content libraries that answer investor questions.

**You have the better product.**

**Let's build the better pipeline.**
