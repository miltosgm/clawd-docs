# Growth Strategy Proposal for Renouveau Capital

**Prepared for:** Renouveau Capital Group  
**Prepared by:** Miltos George | Growth-onomics  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Goal:** €10M AUM from HNWI & semi-professional investors (€10K+ minimum)

## Why Your Track Record Deserves Better Marketing

**22 months. 21 profitable. Sharpe Ratio of 7. Maximum drawdown: 6.11%.**

These aren't numbers you typically see in alternative investments. But here's the problem: most sophisticated investors will never see them because they don't know you exist yet.

Your factsheet tells a compelling story:
- 95.45% monthly win rate (21/22 months profitable)
- Calmar Ratio of 35 (exceptional risk-adjusted performance)
- Transparent expectations: 30-40% annual returns target (not hyped promises)
- Intraday systematic approach with proven methodology

**The disconnect:** Investors searching for "systematic precious metals fund" or "low-volatility alternative strategies" are finding competitors with weaker track records but stronger digital presence.

Let's fix that.

## The Challenge: Selling Sophistication to Sophisticated Buyers

HNWIs and semi-professional investors don't respond to:
- "Get rich quick" claims
- Aggressive sales funnels
- Unverified performance hype

They DO respond to:
- **Educational content** that demonstrates deep expertise
- **Transparent risk communication** (like your factsheet's honest expectations)
- **Credibility signals** (regulatory partners, audited reports, methodological rigor)
- **Peer validation** (other sophisticated investors already in)

Your factsheet already does this brilliantly. We just need to get it in front of the right people—at the right stage of their research journey.

---

## Our Approach: Transparency at Scale

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Build the trust infrastructure before scaling acquisition**

#### 1. Investment Thesis Content Hub
Create a content library that mirrors your factsheet's transparency—but optimized for discovery.

**Content pieces:**
- **"Why a 44.79% Win Rate Beats 80%+ Promises"** — Explaining your risk/reward approach (Blog post)
- **"Sharpe 7, Calmar 35: What These Numbers Actually Mean"** — Risk metrics explainer (White paper)
- **"From 200%+ to 30-40%: Why We're Transparent About Future Expectations"** — Trust-building transparency post
- **"Inside Our Intraday Systematic Approach"** — Methodology breakdown (no secrets, just process)
- **"What €10K Gets You at Renouveau"** — Clear investor expectations (fees, liquidity, reporting)

**Why this works:** You're already being transparent in your factsheet (Pages 3-4 explicitly address sustainability). We amplify that transparency across discovery channels.

#### 2. LinkedIn Thought Leadership
Position a founder/PM as the voice of *rational* systematic investing (anti-hype).

**Content themes:**
- **Transparency wins** — "Here's our worst month (-0.49%). Here's what we learned."
- **Risk education** — "Why maximum drawdown matters more than peak returns"
- **Market commentary** — Data-driven precious metals analysis (no predictions, just methodology)
- **Investor education** — "5 questions to ask any systematic fund before investing"

**Posting cadence:** 3x/week (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday)
**Target:** 5,000+ followers in 90 days → qualified investor pipeline

**Proof point:** I have 16,700 LinkedIn followers in finance/marketing. I'll train your team on the exact content playbook that works.

#### 3. SEO for Bottom-Funnel Investors
HNWIs research for weeks before making allocation decisions. Own the search results.

**Target keywords:**
- "Systematic precious metals fund EU regulated"
- "Intraday trading fund low drawdown"
- "Alternative investment €10K minimum"
- "Aureon strategy Renouveau Capital" (brand defense)
- "Sharpe ratio 7 investment fund"

**Goal:** 1,500+ monthly organic visitors (high-intent, research-stage investors)

---

### Phase 2: Acquisition (Weeks 5-12)
**Once credibility is established, activate paid acquisition**

#### 4. LinkedIn Ads (Primary Channel)
**Why LinkedIn:** Your target (semi-professional investors, HNWIs) are active, identifiable, and receptive to financial content.

**Targeting:**
- **Job titles:** Portfolio Manager, Investment Director, Wealth Manager, Trader, Financial Analyst
- **Interests:** Alternative investments, quantitative trading, systematic strategies
- **Income signals:** Executive titles, premium connections, finance certifications
- **Geography:** EU Tier 1 (Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria)

**Ad creative approach:**
- **No hype. Just facts.** "22 months. 21 profitable. Here's the full track record."
- **Educational angle:** "What a Sharpe Ratio of 7 actually tells you about risk"
- **Transparency hook:** "We project 30-40% annual returns. Here's why." (uses your Page 3 messaging)

**Offer:** "2024-2025 Performance Report + Methodology Breakdown" (gated asset = lead capture)

**Budget:** €3K-5K/month → 50-80 qualified leads/month
**Conversion target:** 8-12% book intro meeting

#### 5. Google Search Ads (Secondary Channel)
Capture bottom-funnel intent when investors are actively searching.

**Target queries:**
- "Invest in systematic trading fund"
- "EU regulated precious metals investment"
- "Low-risk alternative investment fund"
- "€10K minimum investment fund Europe"

**Landing page:** Dedicated page highlighting:
- 95.45% monthly win rate
- Sharpe 7, Calmar 35
- Transparent expectations (30-40% target)
- Clear next steps (schedule intro call)

**Budget:** €2K/month → 20-30 high-intent leads/month

#### 6. Retargeting (Close the Loop)
90% of visitors won't convert on first visit. We follow them with:
- Video explainer (founder discussing methodology)
- Factsheet excerpts (Page 3 transparency messaging)
- Case study/testimonial (if available)
- FAQ content ("What happens during a drawdown?")

**Budget:** €500/month

---

### Phase 3: Conversion & Nurture (Ongoing)
**Turn leads into €10K+ investors**

#### 7. Email Nurture Sequence
**Week 1:** Welcome + Education ("Why systematic beats discretionary")
**Week 2:** Risk transparency ("Understanding our 6.11% max drawdown")
**Week 3:** Methodology deep-dive ("Inside the Aureon strategy")
**Week 4:** Social proof (investor testimonial or case study)
**Week 5:** Performance context ("Why we target 30-40%, not 200%+")
**Week 6:** Call-to-action (schedule introduction meeting)

**Open rates:** 35-45% (finance content outperforms most industries)
**Meeting booking rate:** 10-15% of engaged leads (6-email sequence completers)

#### 8. Webinar Series (Optional Advanced Tactic)
Host quarterly investor education webinars:
- **Q1:** "How to Evaluate Systematic Trading Funds: A Buyer's Guide"
- **Q2:** "Precious Metals in 2026: Market Outlook + Strategy Insights"
- **Q3:** "Risk Management in Alternative Investments"

**Benefit:** Positions you as educator, not salesperson. Attracts serious capital.

## Messaging Strategy: Your Transparency is Your Edge

Most fund managers hide behind vague claims. You're doing the opposite (Pages 3-4 of your factsheet are masterclasses in investor communication).

**We amplify that across all channels:**

### What We DON'T Say:
❌ "Guaranteed returns"
❌ "Get rich with our secret system"
❌ "200%+ annual performance" (without context)

### What We DO Say:
✅ "95.45% monthly win rate over 22 months"
✅ "Sharpe Ratio of 7 with maximum drawdown under 7%"
✅ "We project 30-40% annual returns. Here's why." (links to your Page 3 explanation)
✅ "Risk-adjusted performance over peak returns"
✅ "Audited reports, regulated structure, full transparency"

**This is compliance-friendly AND trust-building.** It's exactly what sophisticated investors want to hear.

---

## Compliance-First Approach

Every piece of content will:
- Include risk disclaimers (per your factsheet language)
- Avoid unverified performance claims
- Get your legal/compliance sign-off before publishing
- Comply with MiFID II, UCITS, and FSC-Mauritius marketing rules

We've worked with regulated financial services brands before. Compliance is non-negotiable.

## Expected Outcomes (90 Days)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Website Traffic** | 2,500+/month | Organic SEO + paid ads |
| **Qualified Leads** | 120-160 | Semi-professional + HNWI investors |
| **Booked Meetings** | 12-20 | 10-15% conversion from engaged leads |

| **LinkedIn Followers** | 5,000+ | Thought leadership account |
| **Content Library** | 12+ pieces | Blogs, white papers, FAQs, videos |

**12-Month Projection:** €2.5M-4M AUM from digital channels (25-40% of your €10M goal)

---

## Investment & Timeline

### Option 1: Full-Stack Growth (Recommended)
**Monthly Retainer:** €4,500  
**Ad Spend:** €5,500-7,500/month (your budget)  
**Total:** €10,000-12,000/month all-in

**What's included:**
- Strategy & execution (LinkedIn, Google, SEO, email, content)
- 12+ pieces of educational content (blogs, white papers, ad copy, email sequences)
- Campaign management & optimization (weekly monitoring, monthly reporting)
- LinkedIn training for your team (teach you the content playbook)
- Monthly strategy calls (review performance, adjust tactics)

**Duration:** 6-month commitment (3 months to build infrastructure, 3 months to scale)

**Why 6 months:** Trust-building takes time. Month 1-2 are foundational. Real momentum starts Month 3-4. By Month 6, you have a repeatable system.

### Option 2: Content + Organic Only
**Monthly Retainer:** €2,800  
**Ad Spend:** €0 (you activate paid later)

**What's included:**
- Content library (12+ pieces over 3 months)
- SEO optimization for investor research queries
- LinkedIn content strategy + training
- Email nurture sequences

**Best for:** If you want to build the credibility foundation first, then activate paid acquisition once content is live.

## Why Growth-onomics?

### 1. We Speak Finance
I've worked with regulated financial services brands. I understand:
- Long sales cycles (6-12 weeks is normal for HNWI allocations)
- Compliance constraints (MiFID II, UCITS, cross-border rules)
- Investor psychology (risk-averse, research-heavy, peer-influenced)

### 2. Performance Marketing, Not Brand Fluff
Every euro spent is tracked. Every tactic is measured. If something doesn't drive qualified leads → meetings → AUM, we kill it and reallocate budget.

**Example:** If LinkedIn ads cost €80/lead but Google is €50/lead, we shift budget to Google. No ego, just ROI.

### 3. LinkedIn Expertise
16,700+ followers in finance/marketing. I know how to build credibility with sophisticated audiences. Your founder/spokesperson will learn the exact playbook that works (content themes, posting cadence, engagement tactics).

### 4. AEO & AI Search Advantage
While competitors focus only on Google, we're positioning you for:
- **ChatGPT** (100M+ searches/day)
- **Perplexity AI** (fastest-growing search engine)
- **Gemini** (Google's AI search)

**Why this matters:** Sophisticated investors increasingly start research with AI. We optimize for these platforms NOW (12-18 month window before competitors catch on).

**Example:** Someone asks ChatGPT: *"What are the best systematic precious metals funds in Europe?"*

Right now, you probably don't show up. In 90 days, you will.

## One Final Thought

You have a 22-month track record that most funds take 5+ years to build. You have a Sharpe Ratio of 7 (institutional investors dream about Sharpe >2). You have transparent, audited performance data starting February.

**The question isn't whether you're ready to scale AUM. It's whether you're ready to compete for attention in a crowded market.**

Right now, investors searching for systematic funds are finding competitors with weaker track records but stronger digital presence. They're allocating capital to funds with Sharpe Ratios of 1.5-2, simply because those funds show up first.

You have the better product. Let's build the better pipeline.
