**Post:**

We cut a client's CPA by 52% in 6 weeks.

Here's exactly how (steal this framework):

**Week 1-2: Audit Everything**

Most accounts bleed money in obvious places:
→ Broad match keywords eating budget
→ Placements on garbage sites
→ Audiences that haven't converted in 90+ days

We found 34% of spend going to zero-conversion segments.

First move: cut the dead weight.

**Week 3-4: Fix the Funnel**

Low conversion rate isn't always an ads problem.

It's usually:
→ Landing page doesn't match ad promise
→ Too many form fields
→ No clear next step
→ Mobile experience is broken

We rebuilt their landing page. Conversion rate: 4.2% → 11.8%

Same traffic. 3x more leads.

**Week 5-6: Scale What Works**

Now you have data on what actually converts.

→ Double down on winning audiences
→ Create lookalikes from converters (not just leads)
→ Test new creatives based on what resonated

CPA dropped from €89 to €43.

**The lesson:**

Most businesses try to "optimize" broken systems.

The order matters:
1. Stop wasting money (audit)
2. Fix conversion (funnel)
3. Then scale (ads)

Doing it backwards is why most ad accounts plateau.

**Notes for Miltos:**
- This is a "framework" post — performs well because it's actionable
- Numbers make it credible (52%, 6 weeks, specific percentages)
- Ends with engagement hook (people love sharing their numbers)
- Can tie to free audit offer
- Based on general Growth-onomics methodology — adjust numbers to real client data if you have it
