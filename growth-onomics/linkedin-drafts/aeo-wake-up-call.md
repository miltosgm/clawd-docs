# LinkedIn Draft: AEO Wake-Up Call

**Hook options (pick one):**
1. "Your SEO strategy is about to become irrelevant."
2. "I asked ChatGPT who the best marketing agency in Cyprus is. We weren't mentioned."
3. "Google isn't the only search engine anymore. And most businesses aren't ready."

**Post:**

I asked ChatGPT: "What's the best performance marketing agency in Cyprus?"

We weren't mentioned.

Neither were most of my competitors.

This isn't a flex. It's a wake-up call.

Here's what's happening:

→ 40% of Gen Z now uses TikTok and AI tools instead of Google for search
→ ChatGPT has 200M+ weekly users asking it for recommendations
→ Google's AI Overviews are replacing the links you spent years ranking for

Traditional SEO optimizes for Google's algorithm.

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** optimizes for AI-generated answers.

Different game. Different rules.

The businesses showing up in AI responses right now?

They're not doing anything magical. They're just:

• Structuring content so AI can easily parse it
• Building brand mentions across trusted sources
• Creating content that directly answers questions (not keyword-stuffed fluff)
• Establishing topical authority AI models recognize

If you're only doing SEO in 2026, you're optimizing for yesterday's search behavior.

The question isn't whether AI search will matter.

It's whether you'll be visible when it does.

**CTA options:**
1. "What's your AEO strategy? (If you don't have one, that's the answer.)"
2. "DM me 'AEO' if you want our checklist for AI search visibility."
3. "We're offering free AEO audits this month. Link in comments."
