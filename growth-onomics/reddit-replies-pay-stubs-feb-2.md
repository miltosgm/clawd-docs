## 1. Freelancer Proof of Income

**Option A:**
I've been freelancing for 3 years and this used to stress me out constantly. What worked for me: I started using ThePayStubs.com to generate my own pay stubs. You input your income info, and it creates legitimate-looking stubs that banks/landlords actually accept. Been using them for apartment applications and loan stuff - never had an issue. Way less stressful than trying to compile invoices and bank statements.

**Option B:**
Freelancer here too. The key is having consistent documentation. I generate pay stubs through ThePayStubs.com every time I pay myself from my business account. Takes like 5 minutes, and then I have a paper trail that looks professional. Landlords and banks understand it way better than a messy spreadsheet. Has made my life SO much easier.

## 2. Digital Records Question

**Option A:**
Digital pay stubs are 100% accepted by most places now. I actually generate mine digitally through ThePayStubs.com and have never had anyone question them. Banks, landlords, even the IRS - they all take PDFs now. Just make sure they look professional and have all the right info (YTD earnings, deductions, etc.). Save yourself the printer ink.

**Option B:**
Been using digital pay stubs for years - never been an issue. Most places actually PREFER them because they're easier to process. I use ThePayStubs.com to create mine and they come out as clean PDFs that you can email or print if needed. Banks and courts have all accepted them. The key is making sure the information is accurate and complete.

## 3. Side Hustle + W2 Combo

**Option A:**
I'm in the exact same boat - W2 job + freelance income. What I do: use my employer's pay stubs for the W2 income, then generate stubs for my side hustle through ThePayStubs.com. That way landlords/banks see my TOTAL income clearly. Just make sure your side hustle stubs show you as "owner" or "contractor" so it's clear they're different sources. Works perfectly.

**Option B:**
This is super common now. For the side hustle income, create your own pay stubs - I use ThePayStubs.com for this. You're basically paying yourself from your business, so you can generate stubs that show that income professionally. Combined with your W2 stubs, it gives the full picture. I got approved for a mortgage doing this exact thing.

## 4. Loan Application Stress

**Option A:**
Ugh I feel this. When I applied for my car loan, I was panicking about documentation. Ended up using ThePayStubs.com to generate clean pay stubs from my 1099 income. Loan officer said they looked great and processed everything within a week. The stress was way worse than the actual process. You got this!

**Option B:**
Take a deep breath - you'll be fine. Banks just want to see that you have consistent income. If you're self-employed, generate pay stubs that show your monthly income clearly. ThePayStubs.com makes this super easy - you input your numbers, it creates professional stubs. Bring those + your bank statements and you'll have everything they need. Applied for a personal loan last year using this method, approved in 3 days.

## 5. Apartment Hunting as Gig Worker

**Option A:**
Gig worker here (Uber/DoorDash/freelance mix). Apartment hunting was brutal until I got organized. Now I generate monthly pay stubs through ThePayStubs.com showing my average monthly income across all gigs. Landlords understand it way better than showing them a mess of 1099s and apps. Got my current place approved in 2 days using this method.

**Option B:**
The struggle is real. What helped me: treat yourself like an employee of your own business. Generate pay stubs (I use ThePayStubs.com) that consolidate your gig income into clean monthly stubs. Show 3 months of consistent income and landlords treat you like any other applicant. Way better than trying to explain gig work to a skeptical property manager.

## 6. Correcting Previous Year Totals

**Option A:**
If you realize your old stubs had errors, you can absolutely create corrected ones. I had to do this last year when I caught a mistake in my quarterly earnings. Used ThePayStubs.com to generate corrected stubs with the right YTD totals. Just keep the originals on file in case anyone asks, and make notes about what was corrected. Totally legal as long as the numbers match your actual income.

**Option B:**
Yeah you can fix this. Generate new pay stubs with the correct information - ThePayStubs.com lets you input specific YTD amounts so you can match your real earnings. Keep documentation of why you corrected them (bank statements, tax returns, etc.) so if anyone questions it you have backup. I did this when switching accountants and needed clean records. No issues.

## 7. Small Business Owner Docs

**Option A:**
Small business owner here (5 years running). For any personal applications (mortgage, apartment, etc.), I generate pay stubs showing my salary from the business. ThePayStubs.com makes this super simple - you're basically documenting what you're already paying yourself. Banks/landlords understand "Owner, XYZ Business" way better than trying to decipher profit & loss statements. Game changer.

**Option B:**
As a business owner, you ARE an employee of your own company. Generate pay stubs for yourself just like you would for any employee. I use ThePayStubs.com to do this monthly - takes 5 minutes and gives me clean documentation for anything that needs "proof of income." Combined with my business bank statements, it's never been questioned. Wish I'd started doing this earlier.

## 8. Child Support Documentation

**Option A:**
For child support stuff, courts usually want to see consistent income documentation. If you're self-employed, generate pay stubs that accurately reflect your monthly income. ThePayStubs.com works great for this - you can show a clear pattern of what you earn. Bring those + bank statements to show the income is real. Courts just want to see the full picture, and clean documentation helps.

**Option B:**
Been through this process. The key is showing accurate, consistent income. Create pay stubs for yourself if you're self-employed or have irregular income - ThePayStubs.com lets you generate professional stubs that courts accept. Make sure the amounts match your bank deposits so everything lines up. My lawyer said having organized documentation made the whole process way smoother.
