## Where Growth-onomics Differs

### 1. Performance Marketing Specialization

Digital Hunch offers many services. Growth-onomics does one thing exceptionally: **performance marketing that drives measurable revenue.**

We don't dilute focus across web design, branding, and social media management. Every strategy ties directly to customer acquisition and ROI.

### 2. AEO & AI Search Expertise

**Growth-onomics is the only Cyprus agency offering Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).**

With AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) changing how buyers find solutions, your brand needs to appear in AI-generated answers—not just traditional search results.

Digital Hunch doesn't offer this. We do.

### 3. Thought Leadership & Transparency

Miltos George (Growth-onomics founder) has 16,700+ LinkedIn followers and regularly publishes insights on performance marketing and AI search trends.

This isn't marketing fluff—it's a track record of expertise you can verify before you hire.

### 4. B2B & SaaS Focus

If you're selling to businesses (not consumers), you need an agency that understands:
- Longer sales cycles
- Lead qualification vs. volume
- Account-based strategies
- LinkedIn and intent data

Growth-onomics specializes in B2B. General agencies often apply B2C playbooks that don't convert.
