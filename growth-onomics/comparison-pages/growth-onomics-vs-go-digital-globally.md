## Where Growth-onomics Differs

### 1. Specialization vs. Generalization

**Go Digital Globally:** "Customized strategies" = flexible generalist approach  
**Growth-onomics:** Specialized in B2B performance marketing = deep expertise in one area

Here's why specialization matters:

A doctor who treats everything is a general practitioner. A doctor who only treats heart conditions is a cardiologist. When you have a heart problem, who do you call?

If you need customer acquisition systems that generate predictable B2B revenue, would you hire:
- An agency that customizes to any business type?
- Or an agency that ONLY does B2B performance marketing?

Generalists are flexible. Specialists get results faster because they've solved your exact problem dozens of times.

### 2. AEO & AI Search — The Invisible Opportunity

**Growth-onomics is the only Cyprus agency offering Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).**

By 2026, 40% of professionals use ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude as their primary search tools. When someone asks AI "Who should I hire for X?" your competitors who appear in those answers are closing deals you never knew existed.

**Go Digital Globally focuses on traditional digital marketing.** That worked in 2020. In 2026, half your market has moved to AI search.

If you're not showing up in ChatGPT's recommendations, you're losing to competitors who are—and you won't even know it happened.

### 3. B2B Expertise vs. General Business

Go Digital Globally works with various business types. That's great for flexibility.

**Growth-onomics specializes in B2B, SaaS, and high-ticket professional services.**

Why does this matter?

**B2B buying is different:**
- Decision cycles: weeks/months, not minutes
- Multiple stakeholders (not just one buyer)
- Lead quality > lead volume (1 qualified enterprise lead beats 100 unqualified visitors)
- LinkedIn + intent data (not just Facebook ads)
- Nurture sequences (not impulse purchases)

Generic "customized strategies" often mean applying B2C tactics to B2B problems. That's like using a hammer when you need a scalpel.

### 4. Thought Leadership & Proven Track Record

Miltos George (Growth-onomics founder) has:
- 16,700+ LinkedIn followers
- Published frameworks on performance marketing, AEO, and B2B growth
- Track record with international B2B clients
- Public methodologies (ROI calculators, playbooks, case study templates)

This isn't hidden expertise—it's verifiable before you hire.

With Go Digital Globally, you're hiring a team with "customized strategies." With Growth-onomics, you're hiring documented expertise you can evaluate upfront.

### 5. Systems vs. Services

**Go Digital Globally:** Customized strategies adapted to your needs  
**Growth-onomics:** Customer acquisition systems with predictable outputs

The difference:

**Strategy = plan.** "Here's what we think will work for you."  
**System = machine.** "Here's the repeatable process that generates X leads per month."

We publish:
- ROI calculators showing expected returns *before* you commit
- Lead magnets demonstrating our methodologies
- AEO readiness assessments with scoring frameworks
- Case study templates with performance metrics

Customization is great. But systems that consistently deliver measurable results are better.

## The Customization Question

Go Digital Globally promises "customized strategies for each business."

That sounds good. But here's the reality:

**True customization in B2B performance marketing comes from:**
1. Deep understanding of your sales cycle
2. Experience with similar deal sizes and buyer complexity
3. Proven playbooks adapted to your specific market
4. Systems that scale as you grow

Generic "customization" often means: "We'll figure it out as we go."

Specialized customization means: "We've solved this exact problem 20 times. Here's the proven framework, adapted to your specifics."

Growth-onomics delivers the second kind.
