## Where Growth-onomics Differs

### 1. Depth vs. Breadth

**Avocadots:** Web design + branding + digital marketing (broad service mix)  
**Growth-onomics:** Performance marketing specialization (deep expertise)

If you need a logo redesign and social media graphics, Avocadots makes sense.

If you need customer acquisition systems that predictably generate revenue, Growth-onomics is built for that.

### 2. AEO & AI Search Expertise

**Growth-onomics is the only Cyprus agency offering Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).**

By 2026, 40% of professionals use ChatGPT as their primary search engine. Your potential customers are asking AI "Who should I hire for X?"

If your brand doesn't appear in those answers, you're invisible to nearly half your market.

**Avocadots focuses on traditional SEO and paid ads.** Growth-onomics ensures you show up in AI-generated recommendations—where buying decisions increasingly happen.

### 3. B2B & SaaS Specialization

Avocadots serves a mix of clients across industries.

**Growth-onomics specializes in B2B, SaaS, and high-ticket services.**

This means:
- We understand long sales cycles (not just impulse purchases)
- Lead quality matters more than volume
- LinkedIn + intent data strategies (not just Instagram ads)
- Account-based approaches for enterprise deals

If you're selling B2B solutions with $5K+ deal sizes, generic creative campaigns don't convert. You need systems built for considered purchases.

### 4. Thought Leadership & Founder Visibility

Miltos George (Growth-onomics founder) has 16,700+ LinkedIn followers and regularly publishes insights on:
- Performance marketing
- AI search and AEO
- Customer acquisition systems
- B2B growth strategies

This isn't marketing copy—it's a public track record of expertise you can verify before hiring.

With Avocadots, you're hiring an agency brand. With Growth-onomics, you're hiring a recognized authority.

### 5. Transparent Methodology

**Avocadots:** "Strategy and creativity" (somewhat abstract positioning)  
**Growth-onomics:** Published frameworks, lead magnets, ROI calculators, playbooks

We document how we work *before* you hire us. This creates trust and clarity around what you're actually buying.
