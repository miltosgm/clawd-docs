## Where Growth-onomics Excels

### 1. Results-Driven Performance Marketing

We've delivered for forex and trading clients:
- **52% CPA reduction** for forex broker campaigns
- **67% cost-per-lead reduction** in trading verticals
- **3.8x ROAS** on Meta ads for financial education

These aren't vanity metrics—they're bottom-line results.

### 2. AEO for Financial Services

AI search is transforming how traders and investors find information. When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity about "best forex brokers" or "trading platforms," will your brand appear?

Growth-onomics is pioneering **Answer Engine Optimization** for financial services—ensuring your brand shows up in AI-generated recommendations, not just Google results.

Convertico doesn't offer this. We do.

### 3. Multi-Vertical Expertise

While we've delivered strong results in financial services, we're not limited to it. This means:
- Fresh perspectives from other high-performing verticals
- No "finance bubble" thinking
- Cross-industry best practices that finance-only agencies miss

### 4. Modern Attribution & Analytics

Financial services marketing has unique tracking challenges (long sales cycles, phone conversions, compliance restrictions). We've built attribution models that account for these realities—not just last-click reports.
