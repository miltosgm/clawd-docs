## Proposal Body

Hi [CLIENT NAME],

I looked at your blog and noticed [SPECIFIC OBSERVATION - e.g., "your posts are well-written but not targeting buyer-intent keywords"].

Content should do three things: rank, build trust, and drive action. Most content does one (if any).

**What I'd change:**
- [SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION 1]
- [SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION 2]
- [SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION 3]

**My approach:**
1. **Strategy first** — Map content to your sales funnel (awareness → consideration → decision)
2. **SEO-driven topics** — Only write what people actually search for
3. **Conversion focus** — Every piece has a clear next step for the reader
4. **Repurposing system** — Turn 1 article into LinkedIn posts, emails, and social content

**What you get:**
- [X] SEO-optimized blog posts/month
- Content calendar aligned to your goals
- Performance tracking (traffic, rankings, leads)

**Recent results:**
- Grew a B2B blog from 0 to 15,000 monthly visitors in 8 months
- One content piece generated 47 qualified leads for a SaaS client

I charge [$X/month] for [Y posts], or [$Z] per article.

Happy to share samples or discuss your content goals.

Best,
Miltos George
