## Proposal Body

Hi [CLIENT NAME],

I just reviewed [THEIR WEBSITE] and spotted [SPECIFIC ISSUE - e.g., "your service pages aren't targeting the keywords your buyers actually search for"].

**Quick wins I'd tackle first:**
- [SPECIFIC FIX 1 based on their site]
- [SPECIFIC FIX 2]
- [SPECIFIC FIX 3]

**Why me?**
I run Growth-onomics, a performance marketing agency. We don't just "do SEO"—we build systems that compound. Recent results:
- Grew organic traffic 340% for a B2B SaaS client in 6 months
- Ranked a real estate site #1 for 47 local keywords in Cyprus
- Built an SEO automation system using AI that publishes optimized content weekly

**My approach:**
1. Technical audit (week 1)
2. Keyword strategy tied to your revenue goals (week 2)
3. Content + link building execution (ongoing)

I charge [$X/month] for ongoing SEO, or [$Y] for a one-time audit + roadmap.

Happy to share case studies or hop on a quick call to discuss your specific situation.

Best,
Miltos George
Growth-onomics | CGO
