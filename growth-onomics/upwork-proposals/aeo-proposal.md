## Proposal Body

Hi [CLIENT NAME],

I searched for "[THEIR PRODUCT/SERVICE]" in ChatGPT and Perplexity. Your competitors showed up. You didn't.

This is the new SEO—except most agencies haven't figured it out yet.

**What's happening:**
- 40% of Gen Z uses TikTok/AI for search, not Google
- AI search traffic converts 5x better than traditional organic
- The brands winning in AI results are the ones structuring content for LLMs

**What I do:**
I help companies get cited, mentioned, and recommended by AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.

**My process:**
1. AI Visibility Audit — Where do you show up (and not show up) across AI tools?
2. Content restructuring — Optimize your pages for AI citation
3. Authority building — Get mentioned in sources that LLMs trust
4. Weekly testing — I prompt-test your brand and iterate

**Recent work:**
- Got a [INDUSTRY] brand mentioned in 8/10 ChatGPT responses for their target queries
- Increased AI-referred traffic by 156% for a B2B client

This is early. The agencies that figure this out now will own the space.

I charge [$X/month] for ongoing AEO, or [$Y] for a visibility audit + strategy.

Want me to run a quick AI visibility check on your brand?

Best,
Miltos George
