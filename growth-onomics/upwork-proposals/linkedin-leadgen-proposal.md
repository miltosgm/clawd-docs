## Proposal Body

Hi [CLIENT NAME],

You're looking for leads. Your ideal customers are on LinkedIn. The problem? Most outreach is terrible, so inboxes are noisy.

I run LinkedIn lead gen that actually works because it doesn't feel like lead gen.

**My approach:**
1. **ICP research** — Who exactly are we targeting? (title, company size, industry, triggers)
2. **List building** — I find 500-1000 qualified prospects matching your ICP
3. **Personalized outreach** — Connection requests + follow-up sequences that sound human
4. **Warm handoffs** — When someone's interested, I hand them to you ready to talk

**What makes this different:**
- No generic "I came across your profile" messages
- Personalization based on their content, company news, or mutual connections
- Focus on starting conversations, not pitching immediately

**Typical results:**
- 30-40% connection acceptance rate
- 10-15% reply rate on follow-ups
- 5-10 qualified conversations/month

**What you get:**
- [X] connection requests/week
- [Y]-touch follow-up sequence
- Weekly report on conversations and pipeline

I charge [$X/month] for done-for-you LinkedIn outreach.

Want me to show you a sample outreach sequence for your ICP?

Best,
