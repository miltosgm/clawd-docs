## Proposal Draft

I read the whole job post. You're not looking for someone to run ads — you're looking for the brain behind the media.

That's exactly where I operate.

**What caught my attention:**

"If your strength is clicking buttons, following templates, or waiting for instructions, this won't be a fit."

Good. I've spent 10 years building growth systems for service businesses. I don't execute tasks — I solve problems.

**How I approach ad strategy:**

Before writing a single creative brief, I answer three questions:

1. **Who's actually buying?** (Not "homeowners 35-65" — the specific person who just spent $50K on a patio remodel)

2. **What's the real objection?** (Usually not price. Usually trust, timing, or "I'll do it myself")

3. **What makes THIS contractor different?** (If the answer is "quality" or "experience," we have work to do)

From there, I build angles. Not "10 hooks to test" — specific positioning that connects business reality to customer psychology.

**For outdoor living contractors specifically:**

This is a visual, high-ticket, trust-dependent category. The ad strategy needs to:
- Lead with transformation (before/after, lifestyle aspiration)
- Build trust fast (reviews, process transparency)
- Pre-qualify for budget and timeline

I'd structure campaigns around buyer intent stages, not just retargeting vs. prospecting.

**What I'd deliver:**

- Clear creative briefs your video editor can execute without guessing
- Strategic direction that connects business goals to ad angles
- Performance reviews with actual recommendations, not just "let's test more"
- Honest feedback when something isn't working

**Quick answer to your screening question:**

"If you had to launch ads for a new brand tomorrow, what's the first thing you'd look at before writing the brief?"

The customer. Not the product, not the competitors — the customer.

Specifically: Who bought recently? Why did they choose this company? What almost stopped them?

Every winning angle comes from understanding who's already buying and why.

**Availability:**
- 15-20 hrs/week
- US timezone overlap (I'm GMT+2, but flexible)
- Available to start immediately

Happy to send a Loom walking through my process if that's helpful.

## Notes

**Why this fits:**
- Strategic role, not button-pushing
- Agency serving local service businesses (aligns with Growth-onomics positioning)
- Low competition (<5 proposals)
- Long-term (3-6 months)
- They value thinking over execution

**Positioning angle:**
Emphasize strategic thinking, customer research approach, and ability to write briefs that editors can actually use.

**Rate consideration:**
$8-12/hr is low for the strategic level they're asking for. Could negotiate up based on value delivered, or position it as retainer-style with performance bonuses.

**Recommended:** APPLY - Good strategic fit, low competition, aligns with Miltos's expertise.
