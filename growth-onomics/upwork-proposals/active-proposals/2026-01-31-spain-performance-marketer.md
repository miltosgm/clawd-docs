## PROPOSAL

Hi,

High-ticket call funnels are my specialty. Lead → quiz → call → sale is the exact architecture I've optimized across multiple campaigns.

**What I bring:**

- **Multi-platform execution:** Meta, TikTok, and Google - I know which platform works best at each stage of the funnel and how to attribute properly across them.

- **Cost-per-booked-call focus:** I don't optimize for CPL. I optimize for booked calls that show up. This means tracking through to the call outcome, not stopping at form fill.

- **Quiz funnel expertise:** Quiz funnels are powerful for qualification but tricky to optimize. I know how to balance completion rate vs. lead quality.

- **Revenue attribution:** You mentioned revenue as a KPI. I set up systems to track from ad click to closed deal so we know true ROAS, not platform-reported ROAS.

**Questions I'd want to understand:**
- Current cost-per-booked-call benchmark?
- Show rate on booked calls?
- Which platform is currently performing best?
- Any creative assets/angles already validated?

Happy to discuss how I'd approach scaling this in Spain.

Best,
[Name]
Growth-onomics

## NOTES
- Short job posting = experienced buyer, knows what they want
- Spain market - might need Spanish-language creative support
- High-ticket = likely coaching, consulting, or education
- KPIs are clear: cost per booked call + revenue
