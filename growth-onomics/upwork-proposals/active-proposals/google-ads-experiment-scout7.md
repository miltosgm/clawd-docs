## Proposal Draft

Hi,

This experiment is exactly the kind of challenge I love.

Manual Google Ads vs AI-powered optimization, built in public, with real stakes and transparent results? Count me in.

**Why this interests me:**

I've spent 10+ years in performance marketing — running and optimizing Google Ads campaigns for e-commerce, lead gen, and SaaS clients. I've also been deeply exploring how AI is reshaping search and advertising (I'm currently building services around AI search optimization).

So the question "Can an experienced marketer beat AI at Google Ads?" is one I genuinely want to answer.

**How I approach campaign strategy:**

Before touching Google Ads, I start with:

1. **Customer research** — Who's actually buying? What's their journey? What questions are they asking before they search?

2. **Competitor analysis** — What's working for others in the space? What angles are saturated vs. underserved?

3. **Positioning and messaging** — What's the unique hook? The reason someone clicks YOUR ad instead of the 3 others above it?

Only then do I build the campaign structure, keyword targeting, and ad copy.

**For this experiment specifically:**

I'd approach it as if Scout7.ai were a real client I'm trying to acquire. I'll document my reasoning at each step — why I chose certain keywords, why I structured campaigns a particular way, why I tested specific angles.

The goal isn't just to win. It's to show *how* strategic thinking compares to algorithmic optimization.

**Relevant experience:**

- Google Ads for SaaS (trial signups, demo bookings)
- Lead gen campaigns for B2B services
- E-commerce ROAS optimization
- Campaign management without automation tools (I started before Smart Bidding existed)

**What I'd need to get started:**

1. Product/service details for Scout7.ai
2. Target audience definition
3. Budget and timeline confirmation
4. Performance metrics we're tracking

Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss the format and expectations.

Let's make this experiment worth watching.
