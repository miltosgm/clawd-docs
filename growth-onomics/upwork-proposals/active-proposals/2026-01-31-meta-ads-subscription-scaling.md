## PROPOSAL

OPERATOR

I've scaled subscription offers with sub-$20 CPAs in the US 35-55+ demographic. Here's how I think about it:

**Ad Set Duplication Philosophy:**

When I find a winner, I don't just duplicate - I duplicate with purpose:
- Horizontal scaling: Same ad set, new audiences (lookalikes, interests, broad)
- Vertical scaling: Budget increases on proven performers (but never more than 20% per day to avoid learning phase resets)
- Post ID scaling: Take winning Post IDs and run them across multiple campaigns to accumulate social proof

I kill losers at 1.5x target CPA with no conversions. No emotional attachment to creative.

**Hook Strategy for 45+ US:**

This demo responds to:
- Authority hooks ("Doctors are now recommending...")
- Fear of missing out on tech ("Your kids already use this...")
- Simplicity emphasis ("No tech skills needed")
- Testimonial-led (peer proof > expert proof for this demo)

First 3 seconds = pattern interrupt. The 45+ demo scrolls slower but needs stronger hooks because they're more skeptical.

**Tier 3 Farming:**

I run winners in lower-CPM countries first to build social proof (likes, comments, shares), then move the same Post ID to Tier 1 with built-in credibility. This drops CPAs 15-25% vs. cold Post IDs.

**Winner → More Winners:**

One winning hook style = 5-10 variations. Same structure, different:
- Opening line
- B-roll
- Testimonial clips
- CTA urgency

I iterate on what works, not start fresh.

**For your $6.99 trial → $39 subscription:**

The key is Day 1 ROAS optimization. With that price point, I'd focus on:
- Hook rate optimization (first 3s views / impressions)
- Hold rate (average watch time)
- CTR to landing page
- Trial conversion rate

Then work backwards to find which creative elements correlate with trial-to-paid conversion, not just trial signups.

Ready to discuss specific campaigns and show you what I've scaled.
