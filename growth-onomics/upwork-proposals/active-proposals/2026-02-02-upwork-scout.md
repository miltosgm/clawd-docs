## ⚠️ Jobs to AVOID

### Red Flags Spotted:
1. **"Need results in 2 weeks"** - Unrealistic timeline, will blame you
2. **$500 budget for full campaign management** - Undervalues expertise
3. **"Must have 10+ years experience in [hyper-specific niche]"** - Too restrictive, likely not serious
4. **20-50+ proposals already** - Low win probability

---

## 📊 Proposal Strategy

### What's working (from past proposals):
- **Strategy-first positioning** - "I'm the brain, not just the hands"
- **Specificity** - Name their exact pain point
- **Proof** - Link to tools (ROI calculator, pricing page)
- **No fluff** - Get to the point fast

### Template structure:
1. **Hook** - Show you understand their specific challenge
2. **Credibility** - Brief relevant experience (not resume dump)
3. **Approach** - How you'd tackle their problem (3-4 steps)
4. **Proof** - Link to relevant asset (calculator, case study, pricing)
5. **CTA** - "Let's discuss" (not "hire me")
