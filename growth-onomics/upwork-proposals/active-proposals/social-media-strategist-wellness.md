## Proposal Draft

You wrote: "This role is not about basic posting or generic content ideas. We're looking for someone who understands strategy first, content second."

That's exactly how I operate.

**My approach to social media strategy:**

I don't start with "what should we post?" I start with:

1. **Positioning** — What's the founder's unique perspective? What does she believe that others in the wellness space don't?

2. **Content pillars** — Not topics, but angles. The recurring themes that build a recognizable point of view.

3. **Conversion architecture** — How does content move someone from "interesting" to "I need to work with her"?

Only then do we talk about formats, frequency, and execution.

**Why wellness/education brands specifically:**

I've worked with thought leaders and personal brands where the founder IS the product. The strategy is different than e-commerce or B2B SaaS.

The goal isn't just reach — it's building the kind of trust that makes someone invest in transformation.

That means:
- Content that demonstrates expertise without being preachy
- Storytelling that creates emotional connection
- Clear pathways from follower to buyer

**What I'd deliver:**

- **Monthly content strategy** — Themes, angles, and messaging direction
- **Content frameworks** — Repeatable structures your team can execute
- **Platform-specific guidance** — What works on Instagram vs. LinkedIn vs. Reels
- **Performance analysis** — What's actually working, and recommendations based on data

I'm not interested in vanity metrics. I care about: Is the content building the brand? Is it converting?

**Relevant experience:**

- Strategy for personal brands and thought leaders
- Instagram organic growth + conversion optimization
- Content frameworks for education/coaching businesses
- Building systems that scale without losing brand voice

**Working style:**

I'm direct, organized, and proactive. I'll tell you what I think is working and what isn't. I work well with founders who want a strategic partner, not just someone to approve their ideas.

**Next step:**

Happy to share 1-2 examples of content strategies I've developed and walk through my thinking on a call.

Looking forward to learning more about the brand and vision.

## Notes

**Why this job matters:**
- $100K+ client spend = serious, professional client
- FEATURED job = Upwork is promoting it
- Long-term (6+ months) = stable engagement
- Expert level = premium positioning
- Wellness/education = aligns with personal brand expertise

**Competition:**
10-15 proposals is higher than the other two jobs, but this is a premium client worth competing for.

**Positioning angle:**
Emphasize strategic thinking over execution. They explicitly said "strategy first, content second" — lean into that.

**Portfolio consideration:**
They asked for examples. Miltos should include:
- Any personal brand work
- LinkedIn growth results (his own profile is proof)
- Content frameworks or strategy docs

**Rate:**
Expert level, 30+ hrs/week, long-term. Should be premium rate ($50-75+/hr given the strategic nature).

**Recommended:** APPLY - Highest-value opportunity of the three. Worth the extra competition.
