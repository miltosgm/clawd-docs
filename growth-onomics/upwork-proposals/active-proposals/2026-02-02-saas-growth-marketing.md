## Proposal

Hi [Client Name],

I just read your post about needing strategic growth marketing for your SaaS product, and one line stood out: "We need someone who thinks strategy first, tactics second."

That's exactly how I approach B2B SaaS growth.

**Here's what I noticed about your challenge:**

You're getting traffic, but conversion rates aren't where they need to be. You're running Google Ads, but not seeing the ROI you expected. And you're wondering if your positioning is clear enough to your ICP.

Sound familiar?

**Here's what's likely happening:**

Most SaaS companies optimize for Google rankings and ad clicks. But your buyers — technical decision-makers, CTOs, product leaders — aren't just searching Google anymore.

They're asking ChatGPT: "What's the best [your category] for [their use case]?"

If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to 40% of your market.

**How I'd approach your first 90 days:**

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Audit current Google Ads campaigns (what's working, what's burning budget)
- Competitive analysis: Where do competitors show up? (Google AND AI search)
- ICP refinement: Get crystal clear on who converts best
- Landing page optimization (most SaaS companies lose deals here)

**Month 2: Optimize & Expand**
- Restructure campaigns based on Month 1 data
- Build Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) strategy
- Create authority content that AI engines reference
- A/B test messaging across campaigns

**Month 3: Scale What Works**
- Double down on winning channels
- Expand to Meta/LinkedIn if data supports it
- Build attribution model so you know what's actually driving revenue
- Document playbook for your team

**Why this approach works:**

1. **Data-driven** - We don't guess, we measure
2. **Full-funnel** - Traffic means nothing if it doesn't convert
3. **AI-first** - I optimize for where buyers actually search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, not just Google)
4. **Transparent** - You'll have real-time dashboard access to all metrics

**Proof this isn't just talk:**

- I built an ROI calculator that pre-qualifies leads by showing realistic projections: [link to roi-calculator.html]
- Here's my transparent pricing structure: [link to pricing.html]
- I write about AEO on LinkedIn (16K+ followers): linkedin.com/in/miltongeorge

**What makes this different from other proposals you'll get:**

Most agencies will promise you "10x growth in 30 days" or overwhelm you with jargon.

I'll tell you the truth: SaaS growth takes 90-120 days to see meaningful results. But when it works, it compounds.

**Next step:**

Let's have a 20-minute call to discuss your specific goals and see if this approach fits.

If we're not a good match, I'll tell you honestly.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

**Strengths:**
- Calls out their exact pain point (traffic but no conversion)

- Honest about timeline (no false promises)

**Positioning:**
- Strategy > tactics
- AI-first (differentiator)
- Transparent (builds trust)
- Consultative, not desperate

**CTA:**

3. Share relevant case study if we have one
4. Send formal proposal with specific projections
