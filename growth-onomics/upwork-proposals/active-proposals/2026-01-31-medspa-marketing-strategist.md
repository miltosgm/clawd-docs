## PROPOSAL

Hi,

I run a performance marketing agency with deep experience in lead generation funnels for service businesses - exactly what medspa growth requires.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

1. **Funnel Architecture** - I've built lead-to-call funnels for high-ticket services. I understand the full journey from ad → landing page → CRM → booked appointment → show rate optimization.

2. **Meta Ads at Scale** - Not boosting posts. Real campaign structures with creative testing, audience layering, and attribution modeling. I optimize for cost-per-booked-call, not vanity metrics.

3. **Conversion Tracking Obsession** - I set up proper CAPI, offline conversion imports, and CRM integrations so you know exactly what's working.

4. **Healthcare/Wellness Adjacent** - I've worked with service businesses where trust and compliance matter.

**What I'd do in the first 30 days:**

- Audit your current campaigns and funnel conversion points
- Identify the biggest leaks (where leads drop off)
- Set up proper tracking if it's missing
- Build a testing roadmap for creative and audiences
- Launch 2-3 new campaign structures targeting your highest-LTV services

**My approach:** I don't just manage ads - I build the system that generates predictable patient acquisition. Strategy through execution.

Happy to hop on a quick call to discuss your current setup and where the biggest opportunities are.

Best,
[Name]
Growth-onomics

## NOTES
- Medspa is high-LTV, recurring revenue (Botox, etc.)
- They want someone who owns the full funnel, not just ads
- Emphasize: CRM integration, lead quality over volume
- Their budget is reasonable for full-time work
