## Growth-onomics Differentiators

### 1. **AEO/AI Search Expertise**
None of the competitors mention Answer Engine Optimization or AI search. This is a clear blue ocean opportunity. Growth-onomics can own this space in Cyprus.

**Messaging angle:** "The only Cyprus agency prepared for AI search"

### 2. **Performance Marketing Depth**
While competitors mention performance marketing, most are generalists. Growth-onomics's B2B focus and deeper expertise is a differentiator.

**Messaging angle:** "We don't do everything. We do performance marketing exceptionally."

### 3. **Miltos's Personal Brand**
16,700+ LinkedIn followers is likely the largest personal brand in Cyprus digital marketing. This creates trust and visibility competitors can't match.

**Messaging angle:** "Learn from the content, hire the expertise"

### 4. **Documented Methodology**
Lead magnets, playbooks, and systematic approaches vs. generic "we do strategy" claims.

**Messaging angle:** "Proven frameworks, not guesswork"

## Market Gaps Identified

1. **AEO/AI Search** - No one owns this yet
2. **B2B SaaS focus** - Most are generalist or B2C
3. **Transparent pricing** - Most hide pricing (opportunity for ROI calculator leads)
4. **Case study depth** - Most have generic testimonials, not results

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Own AEO in Cyprus** - Be the first to rank for "AEO Cyprus", "AI search optimization Cyprus"
2. **Build comparison pages** - "Growth-onomics vs [competitor]" for SEO
3. **Publish case studies** - With real numbers (competitors lack this)
4. **Price transparency** - Use ROI calculator as a differentiator
5. **LinkedIn presence** - Already winning here, double down

## SEO Opportunities

Keywords to target:
- "AEO Cyprus" / "Answer Engine Optimization Cyprus"
- "Performance marketing Cyprus"
- "B2B marketing agency Cyprus"
