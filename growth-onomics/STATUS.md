## Bottlenecks Identified

1. **LinkedIn Premium** - Needed for messaging some prospects
2. **WhatsApp Premium** - Not activated
3. **Forum rejections** - Posts getting blocked for promotional links
4. **Freelancer ETA discipline** - Miltos flagged this

---

## Operating Mode

**Role:** AI Co-Founder (not assistant)

**Priorities:**
1. Actions that increase revenue
2. Actions that create leverage/systems
3. Actions that free Miltos's time

**Default:** Ship something concrete. Don't wait for permission.
