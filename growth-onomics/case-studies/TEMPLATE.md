# NOTES FOR MILTOS

## Best case studies to write first:

1. **Hola Prime** - If you have ROAS/CPA improvement numbers
2. **CDMA** - If there are measurable results
3. **Any client with 100%+ improvement** in a key metric

## What makes a great case study:
- Specific numbers (not "increased significantly")
- Before/after comparison
- Timeline showing progression
- Client quote (even informal)
- Clear problem → solution → result structure

## Quick wins:
- Even a simple 1-pager with key metrics is valuable
- Can use in proposals, website, LinkedIn content
- Screenshots of dashboards (anonymized if needed) add credibility
