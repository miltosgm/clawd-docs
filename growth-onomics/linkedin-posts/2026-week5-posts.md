## POST 1: The AI Search Wake-Up Call
**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9am CET

---

I asked ChatGPT to recommend an SEO agency in Cyprus.

My agency wasn't mentioned.

Neither were 90% of the agencies I know.

Here's who DID show up:
• Agencies with strong backlink profiles from trusted sites
• Brands mentioned in industry publications
• Companies with clear, structured content that answers questions directly

The algorithm isn't broken. We just optimized for the wrong thing.

Traditional SEO = ranking on Google
AI Search = being chosen by ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude

Different game. Different rules.

The agencies that figure this out in the next 6-12 months will own their markets.

The rest will wonder where their leads went.

I'm betting everything on this shift. Are you?

## POST 2: The Solo Founder's AI Stack
**Best time to post:** Thursday, 8-9am CET

---

I run a marketing agency with:
• 4 active clients
• 3 contractors
• 0 full-time employees

And I've never been more productive.

Here's my AI stack that replaced 2-3 hires:

**1. Content production**
→ AI drafts, humans edit. 10x output, same quality bar.

**2. Research & analysis**
→ Competitive research that used to take days? Hours.

**3. Client reporting**
→ Automated dashboards + AI summaries. Clients love it.

**4. Task management**
→ AI assistant that tracks deliverables, sends reminders, drafts follow-ups.

**5. Lead gen**
→ AI finds prospects, drafts outreach, I close.

The truth nobody talks about:

AI didn't replace my team. It let me stay solo longer while doing more.

Small teams with AI > Big teams without it.

What's in your stack?

## POST 3: The AEO Audit Framework
**Best time to post:** Monday or Tuesday next week, 8-9am CET

---

Want to know if your brand exists in AI search?

Here's the 5-minute audit I run for every client:

**Step 1: The Direct Ask**
Open ChatGPT/Perplexity. Ask: "What are the best [your service] companies in [your market]?"

Are you mentioned? If not, why would AI recommend you?

**Step 2: The Comparison Test**
Ask: "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"

What does AI say about you? About them? Where are the gaps?

**Step 3: The Problem Query**
Ask a question your ideal customer would ask (e.g., "How do I improve my website's SEO?")

Does your content get cited? Does your brand come up?

**Step 4: Source Check**
Ask ChatGPT: "What sources would you use to learn about [your industry]?"

Are you on that list? If not, you're invisible to AI.

**What to do with results:**
• Not mentioned at all → Authority problem. Need more citations, backlinks, PR.
• Mentioned but not recommended → Content problem. Restructure for AI readability.
• Recommended → You're ahead. Now optimize and defend.

This is the new baseline for digital presence.

SEO is table stakes. AEO is the edge.

DM me "AUDIT" if you want me to run this for your brand.
