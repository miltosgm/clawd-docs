## POST 1: The Invisible Agency Problem
**Best time to post:** Tuesday Feb 4, 8-9am CET

---

I ran an experiment this week.

Asked ChatGPT: "What are the best performance marketing agencies for e-commerce?"

Then asked Perplexity the same question.

Then Claude.

Here's what I found:

90% of agencies I know — good agencies, profitable agencies — weren't mentioned. Not once.

The agencies that DID appear had three things in common:

• They're cited in industry publications (Search Engine Journal, HubSpot, etc.)
• They have case studies that get linked to by other sites
• Their website content directly answers the questions AI pulls from

The uncomfortable truth:

You can have 50 clients. A great reputation. 10 years of experience.

And still be completely invisible to the next generation of search.

AI doesn't care about your track record.
It cares about your digital footprint.

The question isn't "are we good at what we do?"

It's "can AI find proof that we're good at what we do?"

Different game now.

## POST 2: The Client ROI Question
**Best time to post:** Thursday Feb 6, 8-9am CET

A prospect asked me yesterday:

"What's the ROI of optimizing for AI search?"

Here's what I told them:

If 30% of your target market starts using ChatGPT or Perplexity to find solutions...

And you're not mentioned...

You're invisible to 30% of potential buyers.

That number is growing every month.

The math is simple:

• Current organic traffic: 10,000/month
• Projected AI search share in 12 months: 30-40%
• Potential lost traffic: 3,000-4,000 visitors/month

At a 2% conversion rate and $500 AOV, that's $30,000-40,000/month in potential revenue.

Not "lost" — just going to whoever AI recommends instead of you.

The ROI question is backwards.

The real question is: what's the cost of NOT being recommended by AI?

## POST 3: Why I'm Betting on AI-First
**Best time to post:** Monday Feb 10 or Tuesday Feb 11, 8-9am CET

---

Three years ago, everyone said:

"SEO is dying. Google is too dominant. It's all paid now."

They were wrong.

Now everyone's saying:

"AI search is overhyped. Google isn't going anywhere."

They're wrong again.

Here's what I'm seeing on the ground:

1/ Our B2B clients are getting questions like "What did ChatGPT say about you?"

2/ Decision-makers are using AI to shortlist vendors BEFORE searching Google

3/ The sales cycle is shorter when prospects already "know" you from AI recommendations

The shift isn't coming. It's here.

And the playbook is different:

Old SEO: Rank for keywords
AI Search: Be the answer

Old SEO: Build backlinks
AI Search: Get cited by trusted sources

Old SEO: Optimize for crawlers
AI Search: Optimize for understanding

I'm not saying Google is dead. I'm saying the funnel has a new top.

The brands that control the AI recommendation layer will control demand.

That's where I'm putting my chips.

## POST 4: The Framework Post (Optional Extra)
**Best time to post:** Wednesday Feb 5 or Friday Feb 7

---

Stop creating content for Google.

Start creating content AI can learn from.

Here's my 4-part framework:

**1/ Answer the actual question**

AI pulls content that directly addresses search intent. No fluff. No keyword stuffing. Just clear, structured answers.

**2/ Be quotable**

AI loves concise statements it can cite. Write sentences that work as standalone facts.

**3/ Structure for extraction**

Use headers, bullets, numbered lists. Make it easy for AI to parse and summarize.

**4/ Build authority signals**

Get mentioned in publications AI trusts. One citation in Search Engine Journal > 100 random backlinks.

Traditional SEO: Optimize for algorithms
AI-first content: Optimize for understanding

The content that ranks AND gets recommended?

It does both.
