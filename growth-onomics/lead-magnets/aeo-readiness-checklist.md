## What is AEO?

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the practice of optimizing your brand and content to be recommended by AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google's AI Overviews.

25-30% of research queries now start in AI tools instead of Google. If you're not showing up there, you're invisible to a growing segment of your market.

## What Your Score Means

### 20-25: AEO Ready ✅
Your brand is well-positioned for AI search. Focus on monitoring and optimization.

You have a solid foundation but gaps that could cost you visibility. Prioritize the sections where you scored lowest.

### 10-14: Needs Work 🟠
AI tools probably don't know you exist or don't trust you enough to recommend. You need a structured AEO strategy.

### 0-9: Invisible ❌
You're missing out on 25-30% of potential discovery. AI search is a blind spot that competitors may already be exploiting.
