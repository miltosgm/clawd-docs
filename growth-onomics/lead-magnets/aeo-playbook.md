## How to Get Your Brand Recommended by ChatGPT, Perplexity & AI Search

## What is AEO?

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the practice of optimizing your brand and content to be cited, mentioned, and recommended by AI-powered search tools like:
- ChatGPT
- Perplexity
- Claude
- Google AI Overviews
- Bing Copilot

Traditional SEO = Being found on Google
AEO = Being chosen by AI

---

## Why AEO Matters Now

**The data is clear:**
- 40% of Gen Z uses TikTok or AI for search instead of Google
- AI search traffic converts 5x better than traditional organic (users are further down the funnel)
- ChatGPT has 200M+ weekly active users
- Perplexity processes 100M+ queries monthly

**The window:** Brands that master AEO in the next 6-12 months will dominate their categories. The rest will play catch-up.

## How AI Search Works

AI tools don't "rank" pages. They:

1. **Retrieve** information from their training data + real-time sources
2. **Synthesize** answers from multiple sources
3. **Recommend** brands/products/services based on:
   - Frequency of mentions in trusted sources
   - Quality and structure of your content
   - Authority signals (backlinks, citations, reviews)
   - Recency and relevance

**Key insight:** If AI hasn't "learned" about your brand from trusted sources, it won't recommend you.

## The AEO Framework

### 1. VISIBILITY AUDIT

**Step 1: Direct brand queries**
- Ask ChatGPT: "What are the best [your service] companies?"
- Ask Perplexity: "Tell me about [your brand]"
- Document: Are you mentioned? How are you described?

**Step 2: Comparison queries**
- Ask: "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- Note: What does AI say about each? Where do you win/lose?

**Step 3: Problem queries**
- Ask questions your customers would ask
- Check: Is your content being cited? Your brand mentioned?

**Step 4: Source mapping**
- Ask: "What sources would you recommend to learn about [your industry]?"
- Are you on that list?

### 2. CONTENT OPTIMIZATION

**Structure for AI:**
- Use clear headings (H2, H3) with question-based formats
- Lead with direct answers, then expand
- Include structured data (FAQ schema, How-To schema)
- Create definitive guides that comprehensively cover topics

**Content types that get cited:**
- Original research and data
- Expert roundups and interviews
- Comprehensive guides and playbooks
- Case studies with specific results
- Comparison content (X vs Y)

**Avoid:**
- Thin content that doesn't fully answer questions
- Overly promotional language
- Content that requires navigation to understand

### 3. AUTHORITY BUILDING

**AI trusts sources that humans trust:**

**Backlinks from:**
- Industry publications
- News sites
- Educational institutions (.edu)
- Government sites (.gov)
- High-authority blogs

**Mentions in:**
- Podcasts (transcripts get indexed)
- YouTube videos (captions get indexed)
- Industry reports
- Expert quotes in articles

**Reviews on:**
- G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
- Google Business Profile
- Industry-specific directories

---

### 4. ENTITY OPTIMIZATION

**Help AI understand what you are:**

- Claim and optimize your Wikipedia presence (if notable enough)
- Complete your Google Knowledge Panel
- Ensure consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all listings
- Build connections to related entities (founders, products, industry)

**Schema markup to implement:**
- Organization
- LocalBusiness
- Product
- FAQPage
- HowTo
- Review

1. Run 10 relevant queries across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude

## AEO vs SEO: What Changes?

| Traditional SEO | AEO |
|-----------------|-----|
| Optimize for keywords | Optimize for questions |
| Focus on rankings | Focus on citations |
| Build links for authority | Build mentions for recognition |
| Write for Google's algorithm | Write for AI comprehension |
| Measure traffic | Measure brand mentions |

**The truth:** You need both. SEO is table stakes. AEO is the edge.
