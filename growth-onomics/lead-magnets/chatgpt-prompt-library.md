## Bonus: How to Customize Any Prompt

**The 3-Part Formula:**

1. **Role:** "You are a [SPECIFIC ROLE]" (not just "You are helpful")
2. **Context:** Give 3-5 key facts about your situation
3. **Output format:** Specify exactly how you want the response structured

**Example transformation:**

❌ Bad prompt:  
"Write me a LinkedIn post about AI in marketing"

✅ Good prompt:  
"You are a B2B marketing strategist writing for CMOs at $5M-$50M SaaS companies. Write a LinkedIn post (250 words, 3 bullet points) about why AI search optimization (AEO) matters more than traditional SEO in 2026. Use a contrarian angle. End with a question."

**Difference:** The good prompt produces usable output in one shot. The bad prompt requires 3 rounds of back-and-forth.
