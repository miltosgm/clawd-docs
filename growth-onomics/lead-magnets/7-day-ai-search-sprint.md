## Landing Page Copy

### Headline
**Your Brand Is Invisible to 40% of Your Market**

ChatGPT. Perplexity. Claude.

Millions are using AI to research, compare, and decide what to buy.

If your brand doesn't show up in their answers, you're losing deals to competitors who do.

### Subheadline
**The 7-Day AI Search Visibility Sprint: Get Found in a Week, Not a Year**

No fluff. No theory. Just 7 days of tactical work that gets your brand into AI search results.

---

## What You'll Get

A day-by-day action plan with:
- **Specific tasks** you can delegate or DIY
- **Templates** for authority content
- **Checklists** to verify each day's work
- **Real examples** from brands already winning
- **Quick wins** you'll see within 48 hours

**Total time investment:** 1-2 hours per day for 7 days

---

## The 7-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Authority Foundation
**Goal:** Establish your positioning in structured formats AI can parse

**Tasks:**
- Update your LinkedIn company page with clear positioning statement
- Add structured FAQ section to your website (Schema.org markup)
- Create/update your Google Business Profile with comprehensive service descriptions
- Write 3 "best for" statements (e.g., "Best for SaaS companies scaling from $1M-$10M ARR")

**Why it matters:** AI needs to understand WHO you help and WHAT makes you different. Generic = invisible.

**Template included:** "Positioning Statement Framework"

---

### Day 2: Answer Engine Fuel
**Goal:** Create 5 pieces of content AI engines love to reference

**Tasks:**
- Write one "how-to" guide (800+ words) answering your #1 customer question
- Create a comparison page: "X vs Y" (your solution vs. status quo or competitor)
- Write a "when to use" decision framework
- Publish a listicle: "7 [thing] mistakes" or "5 ways to [outcome]"
- Write a mini case study (even if it's your own experience)

**Why it matters:** AI references sources that provide clear, structured, helpful answers. Be that source.

**Template included:** "Answer-Optimized Content Brief"

---

### Day 3: Third-Party Validation
**Goal:** Get your brand mentioned on sites AI trusts

**Tasks:**
- Submit your company to 3 relevant directories (Capterra, G2, Product Hunt, etc.)
- Respond to 2 relevant Reddit threads with genuine help (mention your brand naturally)
- Comment on 3 LinkedIn posts in your niche with valuable insights
- Reach out to one industry newsletter/blog about contributing

**Why it matters:** AI weighs third-party mentions heavily. You can't just talk about yourself.

**Template included:** "Reddit Response Formula" + "Contributor Pitch Email"

---

### Day 4: Content Distribution Blitz
**Goal:** Get your Day 2 content indexed and cited

**Tasks:**
- Share your content across LinkedIn, Twitter, relevant Slack/Discord communities
- Email it to 10 people in your network who'd find it valuable
- Submit your best piece to aggregators (Hacker News if tech, niche communities)
- Add internal links from your homepage to your new content
- Update your email signature with a link to your best piece

**Why it matters:** AI finds content through links and signals. No distribution = no discovery.

**Checklist included:** "Content Distribution 15-Point Plan"

---

### Day 5: Conversational Optimization
**Goal:** Make your content sound like how people actually search AI

**Tasks:**
- Review your content for natural language (how people ask questions, not keyword stuffing)
- Add "People also ask" sections based on real queries
- Include comparison language ("vs", "better than", "alternative to")
- Add context about use cases, industries, company sizes
- Create a "Quick Answer" box at the top of key pages

**Why it matters:** AI search is conversational. "What's the best X for Y?" not "X services provider."

**Template included:** "Conversational Content Audit Checklist"

---

### Day 6: Technical Foundations
**Goal:** Make sure AI can actually read and understand your content

**Tasks:**
- Add Schema.org markup to key pages (FAQ, HowTo, Organization)
- Check that your sitemap is up-to-date and submitted to Google
- Ensure all pages have clear H1/H2 hierarchy
- Add alt text to images with relevant context
- Speed check (Page Speed Insights) — aim for under 2.5s load time

**Why it matters:** If AI can't parse it, it won't cite it. Technical hygiene matters.

**Checklist included:** "AI-Ready Website Audit"

---

### Day 7: Test & Iterate
**Goal:** See where you rank and plan next steps

**Tasks:**
- Test your brand in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude with 5 relevant queries
- Screenshot results (or lack thereof)
- Document what worked and what didn't
- Identify 3 competitors who DO show up — analyze why
- Plan your next sprint based on gaps

**Why it matters:** This is just week one. AI search is ongoing. Measurement = improvement.

**Template included:** "AI Search Testing Protocol"

---

## What Happens After Day 7?

You'll have:
- ✅ Clear positioning AI engines understand
- ✅ 5+ pieces of authority content published
- ✅ Third-party mentions building credibility
- ✅ Technical foundations for AI discoverability
- ✅ A baseline to measure future progress

**But most importantly:**  
You'll know your brand CAN show up in AI search — because you'll have seen it happen.

---

## Who This Is For

✅ B2B companies with $500K+ ARR  
✅ Founders who know AI search matters but are overwhelmed  
✅ Marketing teams ready to execute (not just "plan")  
✅ Businesses with existing content but zero AI visibility  

❌ Not for: Companies with no website, no clear positioning, or no time to execute

---

## The Cost of Waiting

Every week you delay:
- Your competitor builds more authority citations
- AI models train on data that doesn't include you
- Your sales team misses opportunities they don't even know about

**The window is 6-12 months.** After that, the top 10 brands in every niche will dominate AI search results.

Do you want to be in that top 10? Start this week.

## Objection Handling (FAQ Section)

**"Can't I just wait and see if AI search really takes off?"**

You could. But by the time it's obvious to everyone, the top 10 spots in every niche will be locked in. First-mover advantage is real in AI search.

**"Won't AI just figure out my brand automatically?"**

No. AI references sources it trusts. If you're not creating trust signals (authority content, third-party mentions, structured data), you're invisible.

**"I don't have time for this."**

That's why we made it a sprint. 1-2 hours a day for 7 days. Less time than you spend in status meetings. And infinitely higher ROI.

**"What if I do this and still don't show up?"**

Then you'll know exactly why (we cover that in Day 7). Most likely: your positioning is too generic, or your content isn't differentiated enough. Both are fixable.

**"Is this just SEO with a new name?"**

No. SEO is about ranking in a list of blue links. AI search is about being *chosen* as the answer. Different game, different rules.

## Email Sequence (for nurture)

**Email 2 (Day 3):**
Subject: You're halfway through — here's what to watch for

By now you've completed Day 1-2 (positioning + content).

Day 3 is where it gets interesting: third-party mentions.

Subject: Time to test — are you showing up?

You've done the work. Now let's see the results.

Open ChatGPT and search for "[your industry] solutions for [your target customer]."

Did you show up? Screenshot it. (Seriously, I want to see it.)

If you didn't show up, reply to this email. Let's figure out why.

—Miltos

P.S. If you DID show up, congrats. You're ahead of 90% of your competitors.

**Email 4 (Day 10 - post-sprint follow-up):**
Subject: What's next after the sprint?

You finished the sprint. Now what?

Option 1: Do another sprint focused on a different keyword/topic  
Option 2: Double down on what worked (more content, more mentions)  
Option 3: Let us handle it (Done-With-You or full-service AEO)

Reply with "NEXT" and I'll send you a plan.
