## Template A: Results-Led (Best Performer)

**Subject:** We cut a broker's CPA by 52% — worth a look?

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up from our chat last year.

Since then, we've been deep in the trading space. One result I thought you'd find interesting:

We helped a forex broker reduce their cost-per-acquisition from €127 to €61 in 90 days — while scaling spend by 40%.

The playbook:
- Restructured Meta campaigns around trader intent signals
- Built AI search visibility (ChatGPT, Perplexity now recommend them)
- Fixed attribution leaks that were hiding 30% of conversions

If [Company] is planning any growth push in Q1, I'd love to share the full breakdown.

15 minutes?

## Template B: AI Search Angle (Differentiated)

**Subject:** Is [Company] visible in ChatGPT?

Hi [First Name],

Weird question, but have you searched for "[Company]" or "best forex brokers" in ChatGPT lately?

We're seeing 25-30% of research queries in fintech now start in AI tools instead of Google. Most brokers aren't showing up.

We recently helped a trading platform go from zero AI mentions to being recommended in 4 out of 5 ChatGPT responses for their target queries. Lead quality from that channel is 2.3x higher than paid.

If this is on your radar for 2026, happy to share what's working.

## Template C: Specific Win (Social Proof)

**Subject:** How we scaled a trading platform to 1,200 qualified leads/month

Hi [First Name],

Circling back from our August conversation.

Thought you'd want to see this: we just wrapped a 6-month engagement with a trading education platform. Results:

- 1,247 qualified leads/month (up from 340)
- 67% reduction in CPL
- 3.8x ROAS on Meta
- Now ranking #1 for 12 high-intent keywords

Different niche than [Company], but the principles transfer — especially around intent-based targeting and conversion optimization.

Worth reconnecting if you're planning growth initiatives for Q1?

## Personalized Drafts

### 1. Andrew Vasileiou - SwissQuote

**Subject:** SwissQuote + a 52% CPA reduction playbook

Hi Andrew,

Following up from September — wanted to share something relevant.

We recently helped a European broker cut their CPA from €127 to €61 while scaling spend 40%. The key was restructuring campaigns around actual trader intent signals, not just demographics.

SwissQuote's brand strength could amplify results like this significantly.

Worth 15 minutes to walk through the approach?

### 2. Ana Larson - OctaFX

**Subject:** OctaFX — quick win we found for forex brands

Hi Ana,

Hope 2026 is off to a good start!

Since we spoke, we've been testing AI search optimization for trading platforms. One broker went from invisible to being ChatGPT's #1 recommendation for "best forex broker for beginners" — now driving 200+ qualified leads/month from AI alone.

Given OctaFX's positioning, this could be a quick win.

Interested in seeing how it works?

### 3. Nick Pimenov - Uptrader.io

**Subject:** Uptrader — B2B fintech growth case study

Hi Nick,

Circling back on our conversation from August.

We just finished a campaign for a B2B fintech platform (CRM/trading infra, similar space to Uptrader):

- 340% increase in qualified demo requests
- CAC down 45%
- Now ranking for 23 commercial-intent keywords

If Uptrader is looking at growth for Q1, I'd love to share the playbook.

### 4. Orestis Leonidou - XM.com

**Subject:** What's working for forex brokers in 2026

Hi Orestis,

Quick follow-up from August — I know timing wasn't right then.

Three things we're seeing work for brokers right now:

1. AI search optimization (25% of trader research now starts in ChatGPT)
2. Intent-based Meta campaigns (52% lower CPA vs. standard targeting)
3. Attribution fixes that recover 20-30% of "hidden" conversions

If XM is planning any acquisition initiatives this year, happy to share the details.

### 5. Manswi - Educate2Trade

**Subject:** 1,247 leads/month for a trading education platform

Hi Manswi,

Following up from last year — thought this would be relevant for Educate2Trade.

We just finished a 6-month engagement with a trading education company:

- Went from 340 to 1,247 qualified leads/month
- CPL dropped 67%
- 3.8x ROAS on paid campaigns

The education/trading crossover is a sweet spot for us. Would love to share what worked.

15 minutes this week?

### 6. Anna F. - InstaForex

**Subject:** InstaForex — AI search visibility opportunity

Hi Anna,

Quick question: have you checked if InstaForex shows up when traders ask ChatGPT for broker recommendations?

We're helping forex brands get recommended by AI search tools — one client went from zero mentions to appearing in 80% of relevant ChatGPT queries. Lead quality is 2x better than paid.

If this is on InstaForex's radar, I can share exactly how it works.

### 7. Yossi Tamir - Leverate

**Subject:** Leverate — B2B fintech growth results

Hi Yossi,

Circling back from August.

We've been doing a lot of work with B2B fintech platforms lately. Recent win: 340% increase in qualified demos for a trading infrastructure company, with 45% lower CAC.

Given Leverate's position in the market, I think there's a strong fit.

Worth a quick call to explore?
