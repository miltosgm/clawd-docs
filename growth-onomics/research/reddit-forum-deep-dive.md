## 🔥 KEY FINDING: TikTok Is Working for B2B Agency Lead Gen

**From agency owner who got 10 clients in January 2025:**

> "Surprisingly, tiktok has been a good source for lead gen. I also go live a couple hours a week which has resulted in some new sales as well."

**Breakdown of their 10 clients:**
- 4 from TikTok (found their content, submitted lead forms)
- 2 from existing client referrals
- 1 from employee referral (met at a party!)
- 1 from Google Business Profile (prospect in different city found them)
- 1 from Instagram
- 1 from cold outreach (followed up after initial contact months prior)

**Key insight:** They respond to leads within HOURS with a personalized Loom video. Speed + personalization = conversion.

## 🔥 $6M/Year Agency Owner (181 clients, 49 employees)

**His biggest turning points:**
1. Getting CLEAR on who they serve and what problems they solve
2. Niching down (runs 3 niche-specific agencies now)
3. Building MRR (recurring revenue) so he could plan ahead
4. Personal development (reading, coaching, difficult conversations)

**Quote:**
> "I made all the rookie mistakes—saying yes to bad-fit clients, undercharging, hiring & firing too fast (and too slow)"

## What's Actually Working in Cold Outreach (2025)

From multiple Reddit threads:

### Cold Email Still Works BUT:
- Requires way more effort per prospect
- Better infrastructure needed (warm-up, multiple domains)
- Constant adaptation required
- **Reply rate is the only metric that matters**

### What's Getting Results:
1. **Fewer, more personalized emails** (no lazy templates)
2. **Warming people up on LinkedIn FIRST** before emailing
3. **Mixing channels** (calls + DMs + email, not just one)
4. **Loom video audits** in outreach (highly effective but time-intensive)

### Quote from r/agency:
> "Maybe outbound became all about refining your Ideal Customer rather than sending 10k/month cold emails to everybody on google maps as Twitter gurus say"

## Loom Video Outreach: The Gold Standard

Multiple agency owners confirming this works:

**How they do it:**
1. Research the prospect's website/ads/social
2. Record 3-15 min personalized video audit
3. Send via email or LinkedIn with the Loom link
4. Include specific observations + suggestions

**Results reported:**
- Much higher reply rates than text-only outreach
- Builds trust immediately (they see your face, hear your voice)
- Differentiates you from everyone else spamming text

**Challenge:** Time-intensive. Solution: Only do for highly qualified prospects.

**Tools mentioned:**
- Loom (obviously)
- MailMoo (for scaling personalized video)
- HeyGen + Make.com (AI-generated personalized intros)

---

## Referral Programs: What Actually Works

From r/agency discussions:

**Common structures:**
- 10% of first project value (one-time)
- 10% of profit for lifetime of client relationship
- $500-1000 flat fee per qualified referral
- "Padding" new work pricing to cover referral fees

**Who to partner with:**
- Larger agencies who don't do your service
- Software companies serving same audience
- Freelancers who get asked for services outside their scope
- Business coaches/consultants
- Accountants/lawyers who serve business owners

**Key insight:**
> "Most referrals are one-offs from other agencies, clients, other marketers. We have about 3 partners who refer regularly (more than 2x/year)"

You don't need 100 partners. 3-5 who send 2+ referrals/year = meaningful revenue.

## The "Free Audit" Strategy: Pros and Cons

**What works:**
- Free audits DO convert... if they're genuinely valuable
- Video audits convert better than written PDFs
- Speed matters: send within 24-48 hours of request

**What doesn't:**
- Generic audits that anyone could get
- Audits that are just sales pitches in disguise
- Taking too long to deliver

**Pro tip from thread:**
> "Watch those 20 loom videos you have and see how you would react to yourself"

Self-audit your audits.

---

## Strategic Partnerships: The Underrated Channel

**From client acquisition thread:**

> "Warm outbound – Personalized LinkedIn DMs and emails to niche-specific prospects, focusing on specific pain points"
> 
> "Strategic partnerships – Collaborating with non-competing agencies or consultants who serve the same audience"

**Why partnerships work:**
- Borrowed trust (their client already trusts them)
- No "cold" barrier to break through
- Revenue share aligns incentives
- Often leads to recurring referrals

---

## Content Distribution > Content Creation

From r/content_marketing:

> "Biggest shift for me is that distribution matters more than the content itself. Great posts go nowhere without a system, but even simple content performs when it's consistently distributed."

**Implication:** You don't need more content. You need to distribute what you have better.

---

## Client Churn: The Hidden Problem

From multiple threads:

> "The real issue is agencies suck at marketing themselves because they're too busy doing client work. Client retention and churn is huge. Agencies lose clients constantly and replacing them is expensive as hell."

**Insight:** Sometimes the best "new client" strategy is keeping existing clients longer.

## NEW IDEAS FROM THIS RESEARCH

### 26. **TikTok for B2B Lead Gen**
It's working. Create short-form content showing your expertise:
- Quick ad audits
- Marketing tips
- Behind-the-scenes of client work
- Live Q&As

**What I can do:** Script videos, research trending formats, edit clips

---

### 27. **Speed-to-Lead System**
Agency got 10 clients by responding within hours with personalized Loom.

**What I can do:** 
- Monitor all lead sources
- Draft immediate response templates
- Create Loom script templates
- Set up notifications for new inquiries

---

### 28. **The "Warm Then Cold" Sequence**
Don't cold email first. Warm them up on LinkedIn first.

**Sequence:**
1. Connect on LinkedIn
2. Engage with their content for 1-2 weeks
3. Then send personalized email
4. Reference your LinkedIn interaction

**What I can do:**
- Build target list with LinkedIn profiles
- Draft engagement comments for their posts
- Write the follow-up email sequence

---

### 29. **Partner Outreach Campaign (v2)**
Focus on getting 3-5 consistent referral partners, not 50 random ones.

**Better targets:**
- Web agencies who explicitly say "we don't do marketing"
- HubSpot/Salesforce consultants
- Business coaches with marketing-struggling clients
- Accountants for SMBs

**What I can do:**
- Research and qualify 20 high-potential partners
- Draft personalized outreach for each
- Create partnership one-pager
- Track and follow up

---

### 30. **AI-Personalized Video at Scale**
Use HeyGen + Make.com to create semi-personalized Loom-style videos.

**How it works:**
- Record base video once
- AI inserts personalized intro (their name, company)
- Scale to 50+ prospects per day

**What I can do:**
- Research and set up the automation
- Write the base script
- Build the workflow

---

### 31. **"Found You On [X]" Outreach**
Multiple clients came from being found on TikTok, Google Business, etc.

**Action:** Make sure Growth-onomics is visible everywhere prospects might search:
- Google Business Profile (optimized)
- TikTok presence
- YouTube presence
- Clutch/DesignRush listings
- LinkedIn company page

**What I can do:**
- Audit all profiles
- Optimize listings
- Create/improve Google Business Profile

---

### 32. **The "Party Referral" Play**
One client came from employee referral — met at a party.

**Insight:** Personal networks are underutilized. Everyone knows someone who needs marketing help.

**What I can do:**
- Draft "referral request" email for your personal network
- Create simple referral incentive structure
- Build tracking system

---

### 33. **Target Agencies Who Fired Theirs**
From thread: Client fired 5 agencies in 6 weeks.

**These companies have budget and are actively looking.**

**What I can do:**
- Monitor LinkedIn/Twitter for "looking for new agency" posts
- Draft rapid-response outreach
- Create "Why agencies fail" content that positions you differently

---

## SUMMARY: What We're Missing

Based on research, Growth-onomics could add:

1. **TikTok presence** — surprisingly effective for B2B
2. **Speed-to-lead system** — respond within hours, not days
3. **Loom video outreach** — higher conversion than text
4. **Strategic partners** — focus on 3-5 consistent ones
5. **LinkedIn warm-up before cold email** — multi-touch approach
6. **Google Business Profile optimization** — people find agencies there
