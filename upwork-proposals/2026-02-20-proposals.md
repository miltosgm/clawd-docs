## Job 1: AEO Specialist (GEO, LLM SEO, AI SEO Expert)

**URL:** https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/apply/AEO-Specialist-GEO-LLM-SEO-SEO-Expert_~021995401304404314788/
**Applied:** Pending Miltos login

### Cover Letter

Hi,

I've been specializing in AEO and GEO since early 2024 — before most agencies even knew what to call it.

My background: CGO at Growth-onomics, where I design AI-era visibility strategies for clients. I also share daily insights on LinkedIn (16,700+ followers) specifically on how brands can get cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini rather than just ranked on Google.

**What I can deliver:**

• Content architecture optimized for LLM retrieval (entities, schema, semantic depth)
• AI presence audits — which tools cite you, how, and for what queries
• GEO strategy: structured data + E-E-A-T signals that make AI tools trust your brand
• Competitive gap analysis: why competitors appear in AI answers and you don't
• Dual optimization: Google rankings AND AI citation coverage

I've run this process for real clients across fintech, real estate, and B2B SaaS. I know what actually moves the needle vs. what sounds good in a proposal.

Happy to share a sample AI visibility audit on your domain before you commit to anything.

Best,
Miltos George

## Job 2: SEO/AEO/GEO Consultant

### Cover Letter

Hi,

The fact that you're hiring for SEO + AEO + GEO together tells me you understand where search is heading. That's exactly the intersection I work in.

**Quick background:**
- CGO at Growth-onomics — full-stack search strategy (traditional SEO + AI-era AEO/GEO)
- 16,700+ LinkedIn followers where I write about AI search optimization daily
- Hands-on client work across multiple verticals — fintech, real estate, B2B

**What a consulting engagement with me looks like:**

Month 1: Baseline audit — Google rankings, AI visibility (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini), content gaps
Month 2: Strategy + implementation — structured data, FAQ optimization, entity building, citation-worthy content
Ongoing: Weekly reporting, iteration, competitive monitoring

I don't just make recommendations. I execute — or I work directly with your team to implement.

The window to get ahead in AEO is still open, but it's closing. Brands that build AI presence now are the ones that will dominate when the dust settles.

If you want to see what this looks like in practice, I can do a quick AI presence audit on your domain — no commitment needed.

Looking forward to connecting.
