## Our Proposal

**Proposed Rate:** $35/hr

### Cover Letter

Hi there,

Adonis looks like a solid brand with strong creative direction - exactly the type of DTC project I enjoy working on.

I'm Miltos, CGO at Growth-onomics where I lead performance marketing for e-commerce and DTC brands. I've managed significant Meta ad spend across apparel, lifestyle, and subscription brands, with a focus on customer acquisition cost optimization and full-funnel campaign architecture.

What caught my attention about this role: you already have strong creative assets (rare and valuable), clear brand positioning in a niche with room to scale, and you're thinking about the full customer journey from acquisition to email/SMS to retention.

I'm hands-on with Meta Ads Manager daily, comfortable with Klaviyo integration, and experienced with the prospecting-to-retargeting flow that DTC brands need to scale profitably.

Happy to do a quick test period to prove the results. Looking forward to discussing your current metrics and where the biggest opportunities are.

Miltos

### Screening Question 1: What does your first 7 days look like when working with a new brand?

Days 1-2 are about doing a deep dive into your brand, creatives, website, and existing data. I'll audit the pixel setup, review past campaign performance, and understand your customer journey from first touch to purchase.

Days 3-4 focus on campaign architecture planning. I'll map out the funnel structure (TOF/MOF/BOF), identify your strongest creative assets, and define initial audience segments for testing.

Days 5-7 are for launching the first campaigns with a structured testing approach. I'll set up 2-3 prospecting campaigns with varied audiences and creatives, plus retargeting for site visitors and cart abandoners. By end of week one, we'll have live campaigns and initial data to optimize from.

### Screening Question 2: How do you typically structure campaigns for Prospecting, Retargeting, and Retention?

For prospecting, I use broad audiences combined with interest stacks and lookalikes (usually 1-3% of purchasers). I test multiple creative angles here like lifestyle shots, product features, and social proof. Objective is usually Conversions optimized for Purchase or Add to Cart.

For retargeting, I segment by engagement level. This includes website visitors from the last 7-30 days (excluding purchasers), cart abandoners with urgency messaging, product viewers for specific product retargeting, and video viewers who watched 50%+ along with other engaged users.

For retention, I run post-purchase campaigns for repeat buyers, cross-sell campaigns for complementary products, and win-back campaigns for lapsed customers (90-180 days). This layer is often neglected but has the best ROAS.

Each layer has its own budget allocation and KPIs. I typically start 60/30/10 (prospecting/retargeting/retention) and adjust based on performance.

### Screening Question 3: How do you structure paid ads to acquire new customers and move them into an email and/or SMS list?

I typically use two approaches depending on the product and goals.

The first is direct purchase with post-purchase capture. I optimize for purchases, then capture emails through post-purchase flows. This works well for impulse-buy products where the order confirmation becomes the email capture point, plus I set up abandoned cart flows to capture non-converters.

The second is a lead magnet approach. For higher AOV items or when building lists fast, I run Lead Gen campaigns offering value like a discount code, style guide, or early access. These feed directly into Klaviyo flows including a welcome series, abandoned browse/cart triggers, and SMS opt-in incentive.

For Adonis specifically, I'd likely start with the direct-to-purchase approach given you have strong creative, then layer in a 10-15% discount lead capture for cold traffic that's not ready to buy yet. This builds your list while still driving immediate revenue.
