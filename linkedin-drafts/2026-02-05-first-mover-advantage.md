## Post

The window is closing.

Not in 5 years. Not in 2 years.

**12 months.**

After that, the top 10 brands in every category will own AI search results. And breaking in will be 10x harder.

Here's why 👇

**How AI search results work:**

Unlike Google (where you can buy your way to the top with ads), AI engines recommend based on:

• Authority signals accumulated over time
• Credibility from third-party sources
• Content that's been indexed and validated
• Brand mentions across trusted platforms

You can't shortcut this.

You can't pay for position #1.

You have to *earn* it.

**The first-mover advantage:**

Right now, most businesses aren't optimizing for AI search.

That means:

✅ Less competition for authority positioning  
✅ Easier to build credible source citations  
✅ More opportunities to create category-defining content  
✅ Lower cost to dominate your niche

**12 months from now:**

❌ Your competitors have published 100+ authority articles  
❌ They're cited by every major industry source  
❌ AI engines default to recommending them  
❌ Your content is "too new" to be trusted  

**This happened with SEO in 2010-2012.**

Early adopters dominated. Latecomers spent years (and millions) trying to catch up.

Many never did.

**AI search is following the same pattern.**

Except faster.

**What to do:**

You have two options:

**Option 1:** Wait until "everyone is doing it" and fight an uphill battle for years.

**Option 2:** Start now, build authority while it's still accessible, and lock in your position.

**The reality:**

In 12 months, I'll write a post saying "I told you the window was closing."

Some will say "I wish I started earlier."

Others will say "Glad I acted when it mattered."

Which one will you be?

## Notes
- Creates urgency without being salesy
- Uses SEO historical example (credible comparison)
- Clear two-option framing (psychological trigger)
- Strong P.S. CTA that drives engagement + DMs
- "12 months" is specific and memorable
- Taps into FOMO but backs it with logic
- Positions Miltos as the one who called it early (authority builder)
