# Feb 23 — Agency vs. In-House: What Changed With AI

---

3 years ago, the "build vs. buy" debate in marketing was about headcount.

Hire an in-house team or work with an agency?

The answer was mostly economic.

That's changed.

Here's the new version of that debate 👇

**The old argument for in-house:**
• Deep product knowledge
• Faster feedback loops
• Lower cost at scale

**The old argument for agency:**
• Specialized expertise
• Cross-industry perspective
• Flexible capacity

**What AI changed:**

The expertise gap is closing. Fast.

A good in-house marketer with strong AI tools can produce output that used to require a team.

But AI amplifies strategy. It doesn't replace it.

And that's where agencies still win — if they've adapted.

The agencies charging for volume (content, ads, reports) are getting squeezed.

The ones charging for *thinking* — strategy, audience insight, channel architecture — are more valuable than ever.

Same thing on the in-house side.

If your team is still doing execution work that AI can do, you have a headcount problem.

The best in-house marketers right now are AI power users + strategic thinkers.

Not content factories.

One thing is clear:

The "hire 6 people to do the work" model is dead.

The future is 2 exceptional people + the right systems.
