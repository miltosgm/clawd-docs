**Angle:** Distribution > content quality  
**CTA:** How many platforms are you on?

## Post

You wrote the perfect blog post.

Great headline. Solid research. Actionable takeaways.

You posted it on your website.

6 months later: 47 views, 0 leads.

Here's why (and how to fix it) 👇

**The Uncomfortable Truth:**

Content quality is 20% of the equation.

Distribution is 80%.

Most creators have it backwards.

They spend 80% of time writing the "perfect" post.

They spend 20% (or 0%) on distribution.

**The math:**

Mediocre post + great distribution = 10,000 views, 50 leads

Great post + mediocre distribution = 500 views, 2 leads

Distribution wins. Every time.

**Why most distribution fails:**

**#1: "Build it and they will come"**

Posting on your blog is not distribution. It's just publication.

Distribution means: putting your content where your audience already is.

**#2: One-platform strategy**

"We'll post on LinkedIn"

LinkedIn is great. But 70% of your audience isn't there.

They're on:
- Twitter/X (tech audience)
- Reddit (community validation)
- YouTube (video preference)
- Email (direct relationship)
- Company blog (credibility)
- Industry forums (active discussion)

One platform = one source of views.

**#3: No repurposing**

"We wrote a great post. We posted it."

That's one distribution attempt.

Meanwhile, the post could become:

- Thread on Twitter (reach different audience)
- Email series (convert to subscribers)
- LinkedIn post (different format)
- Video script (YouTube audience)
- Podcast talking points (audio audience)
- Infographic (visual learners)
- Slide deck (presentation ready)

Same content. 7 different formats. 7x more reach.

**What works:**

**1. Reverse engineer the distribution**

Before you write, ask:

- Where does my audience spend time?
- What format do they prefer there?
- How often do they want this content?
- Who can amplify this (influencers, communities)?

THEN write for that format.

**2. Build an owned channel**

Email list is your moat.

You own it. Platforms don't.

Every piece of content should drive email signups.

Email is your distribution safety net.

**3. Repurpose aggressively**

1 pillar piece = 7 distribution formats:

- LinkedIn post (professional audience)
- Twitter thread (tech/entrepreneur audience)
- Email (direct audience)
- YouTube video (long-form audience)
- Reddit (community validation)
- Blog post (SEO + credibility)
- Slack/Discord (community audience)

Same research. Different format. Different audience.

**4. Use distribution multipliers**

Don't just post to your channels.

Get others to share:

- Tag relevant accounts (they might retweet)
- Ask your community (give them reasons to share)
- Create controversy (people share strong opinions)
- Partner with creators (co-distribution)

**Real example:**

Company A (no distribution):
- Blog post: 300 views, 1 lead
- Time: 8 hours

Company B (distribution-first):
- Same post, reformatted for 5 platforms
- Direct reach: 2,500 views, 8 leads
- Amplified reach (shares): 15,000 views, 45 leads
- Time: 10 hours (only 2 extra)

Same content. 50x better results.

**Where most people mess up:**

They optimize for content quality when they should optimize for distribution.

They write in a vacuum instead of for where people actually are.

They publish once instead of distributing everywhere.

**The distribution checklist:**

- [ ] Identify where your audience is (not where you want them to be)
- [ ] Format for that platform
- [ ] Post on that platform
- [ ] Repurpose to 3+ other formats
- [ ] Use amplification tactics (tags, asks, partnerships)
- [ ] Drive to email list
- [ ] Measure which distribution channel converts best

**What's your current distribution strategy?**

Are you focused on content quality or on reaching actual people?
