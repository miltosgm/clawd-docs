# March 1 — If ChatGPT Doesn't Know You Exist, Neither Do Your Buyers

---

Go ask ChatGPT a question your ideal customer would ask.

Something like: "What's the best [your category] for [your use case]?"

Is your brand in the answer?

If not — that's not a traffic problem. That's a brand visibility problem.

Here's why this matters now 👇

40%+ of people aged 18-35 are using AI tools as their first search step.

Not Google. Not LinkedIn. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude.

They ask a question. They get a synthesized answer with 2-3 recommended brands.

If you're not in that shortlist, you don't exist for that buyer.

This is the new "first page of Google."

Except it's harder to get there, and most brands have no strategy for it.

**What gets you cited by AI:**

1/ Being mentioned on credible, high-authority websites (not just your own content)

2/ Having structured, expert content that directly answers common questions in your category

3/ Strong E-E-A-T signals — AI trusts what the internet trusts

4/ Consistent brand presence across multiple reputable sources

**What doesn't help:**
• More blog posts on your own site
• Social media posts (mostly not indexed by AI training data)
• Ad spend

This is a long game.

Which is exactly why you should start now.

The window to establish AI visibility before your category gets crowded is 6-12 months.

After that, the brands already there are very hard to displace.
