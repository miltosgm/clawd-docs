# Feb 22 — 3 Questions Every CMO Should Be Asking Right Now

---

Most CMOs are still measuring marketing the same way they did in 2022.

The game has shifted. The scoreboard hasn't.

Here are the 3 questions I'd be asking if I were a CMO today 👇

**1. "What % of our traffic comes from AI-referred intent?"**

Not AI-generated traffic. *AI-influenced* decisions.

Someone asked ChatGPT a question. Got an answer. Then came to your site.

That's an AI-influenced visit — and it'll behave differently than Google traffic.

Most GA4 setups don't capture this. Fix that first.

**2. "Where does our brand appear in AI conversations about our category?"**

Go ask Perplexity: "Who are the leaders in [your space]?"

If you're not mentioned, you're invisible to a growing segment of buyers.

That's a brand problem, not an SEO problem.

**3. "What would our marketing look like if Google disappeared tomorrow?"**

This sounds extreme. It's not.

Google's share of search is shrinking. Slowly, then suddenly.

The CMOs stress-testing this scenario now are the ones who won't be caught off-guard.

None of these questions are comfortable.

That's the point.

The brands asking hard questions in 2024 are the ones building competitive moats in 2026.

Which of these is hardest to answer for your business?
