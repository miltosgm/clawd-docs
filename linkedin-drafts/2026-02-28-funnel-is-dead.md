# Feb 28 — The Marketing Funnel Is Not Dead. It's Just Nonlinear Now.

---

"The funnel is dead."

I've seen this take 50 times this year.

It's not dead. It's just not a funnel anymore.

Here's what I mean 👇

The traditional funnel assumed buyers moved in one direction: Awareness → Consideration → Decision.

Predictable. Sequential. Measurable.

That model worked when buyers had limited information and your sales team controlled the narrative.

Today, a B2B buyer might:
• Watch 3 of your YouTube videos
• See 6 LinkedIn posts from your founders
• Read a competitor comparison on Reddit
• Ask ChatGPT who the best option is
• Get recommended by a peer in a Slack community
• Then book a demo

They didn't follow your funnel. They followed their own research path.

And you had influence at every step — or you didn't.

**What this means for marketers:**

The old question: "What's our conversion rate at each funnel stage?"

The new question: "Are we present in every place buyers go to form opinions?"

This is why GEO matters.
This is why community matters.
This is why founder content matters.

You're not guiding a buyer through a funnel.

You're building enough presence that when they're ready to decide, you're the obvious answer.

One thing is clear:

The brands that show up consistently across multiple channels — even the ones they can't track — will win the deals that never show up in attribution reports.

How many of your closed deals could you fully attribute to one channel? Honest answer.
