# Feb 20 — Audit Your AI Presence (Do This Today)

---

Most brands have no idea if AI recommends them.

They track Google rankings. They don't track AI visibility.

Here's a 15-minute audit you can run right now 👇

**Step 1: Ask the AI tools your buyers use**

Open ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini.

Ask: "Who are the best [your service] providers in [your market]?"

Do you appear? How are you described? What's the context?

**Step 2: Check your citations**

Search your brand name in Perplexity specifically.

What sources are they pulling? Are any of them yours? Are they accurate?

**Step 3: Test your answer coverage**

What are the top 10 questions your ideal clients ask?

Ask them to AI. Does your content answer them? Are you cited?

**Step 4: Benchmark competitors**

Same questions. Do they appear and you don't?

That's your content gap.

What you'll find:

• 80% of brands have zero AI presence
• Competitors with strong PR and long-form content dominate
• The "right" answer is rarely the biggest brand — it's the most cited one

This is the new SEO audit.

Run it quarterly. Act on it monthly.

The brands that know where they stand are already ahead.

Run this today and tell me what you find. Genuinely curious what most people discover.
