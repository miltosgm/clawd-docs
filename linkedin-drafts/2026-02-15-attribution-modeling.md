## Post

Most marketing teams are making decisions based on completely wrong data.

Not because they're lazy. Because their attribution model is broken.

Here's what's happening (and how to fix it) 👇

**The Problem:**

Platform attribution says:

"Google Ads drove 40% of conversions"
"Social Media drove 25%"
"Organic drove 20%"
"Email drove 15%"

You believe it. You allocate budget based on it.

6 months later: wrong decision, wasted budget, missed targets.

**Why the data is wrong:**

**Last-click attribution bias:**

Customer journey:
1. Facebook ad (awareness)
2. Google search (research)
3. LinkedIn message (relationship)
4. Email (decision)

Last-click model: "Email gets 100% credit"

Reality: All 4 touchpoints contributed.

**Cross-device tracking gaps:**

Customer sees ad on phone. Researches on desktop. Buys on tablet.

Your system only sees 1-2 of those touches.

You're missing 30-50% of the customer journey.

**The cookieless future:**

Third-party cookies are gone (or going).

Your pixel-based tracking is becoming unreliable.

You're making decisions on incomplete data.

**What to do instead:**

**1. Track the full journey**

Use UTM parameters + CRM data + email platform data.

Connect: which ad → which email → which page → which call → which sale.

Map the entire customer journey, not just the last click.

**2. Use multi-touch attribution**

Give credit to all touchpoints:

- First touch: 20% (they introduced the brand)
- Middle touches: 30% (they built conviction)
- Last touch: 50% (they closed)

(Adjust percentages based on YOUR data)

**3. Run incrementality tests**

Stop running ads to a test segment.

Measure: did they still convert?

If yes → that channel wasn't driving incremental revenue.

If no → that channel was actually valuable.

This is the only way to know for sure.

**4. Model cohorts, not individual clicks**

Instead of: "This click drove a conversion"

Think: "Customers who saw Ad A + Email B converted at 8%"

Customers who saw Ad C + Email B converted at 3%"

Model the combinations. Not individual touchpoints.

**Real example:**

Company A (wrong model):
- Thought Facebook drove all conversions
- Cut Google budget 50%
- Revenue dropped 35%

(The Facebook + Google combo was the driver. Removing one killed the effect.)

Company B (right model):
- Tested with incrementality tests
- Found Facebook alone wasn't driving much
- Google + Facebook combo was the winner
- Optimized the combo, grew revenue 25%

Same channels. Different models. Opposite outcomes.

**The hard truth:**

Perfect attribution is impossible.

But "good enough" attribution beats "completely broken" attribution.

Most companies are in the broken category.

**Where to start:**

1. Audit your current model (last-click? multi-touch?)
2. Map the actual customer journey (use a whiteboard, be honest)
3. Run one incrementality test this month
4. Compare results to your current model

Watch the gap. That gap is your lost revenue.

**What attribution model are you using?**

And more importantly: do you actually trust it?

## Notes
- Technical breakdown (shows expertise)
- Real examples (credible)
- Actionable steps (readers can implement)
- Contrarian (attacks standard practices)
- Shows cost of ignorance (revenue lost)
- Positioning: Miltos as measurement expert
- Invites specific engagement (asks about their model)
