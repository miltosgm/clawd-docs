## Post

I met with 12 founders last month.

Each one had an impressive headline:

"2M impressions last quarter."
"500K reach on our content."
"15K new followers."

None of them could tell me their actual cost per acquisition.

**That's the death signal.**

Chasing metrics that feel good instead of metrics that pay the bills.

Here's what I obsess over instead 👇

**The metrics that matter:**

✅ Cost per acquisition (not impressions)
✅ Lifetime value per customer (not followers)
✅ Conversion rate by source (not total traffic)
✅ Payback period (not engagement rate)
✅ ROI by channel (not total spend)

Everything else is noise.

**Why founders get this wrong:**

Impressions are *easy to see*.

On your dashboard. Every day. Growing.

ROI is *hard to calculate*.

It requires: tracking, cleanup, attribution, honest math.

So most people don't do it.

They report the easy metric. Call it a win. Move on.

**The difference:**

A brand with 50K impressions and 5% conversion = $250K revenue (at $100/customer)

A brand with 500K impressions and 0.2% conversion = $100K revenue

Same industry. Same budget probably.

One founder is shipping. One is celebrating vanity.

**How we think about it at Growth-onomics:**

Every dollar we spend should come back as 3-5x.

If it doesn't, we kill it.

We don't wait. We don't optimize. We kill it and try something else.

**The hard truth:**

Most marketing is theater.

It *looks* good. It *feels* productive.

But the numbers are broken.

Shift to ROI obsession and everything changes.

Your campaigns will look different.
Your metrics will change.
Your results will multiply.

**What's your biggest "vanity metric" miss?**

Drop it in the comments. I'll share how you could reframe it for actual ROI.
