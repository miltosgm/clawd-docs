# March 9 — Acquisition Gets the Budget. Retention Builds the Business.

---

The most dangerous metric in marketing is new MRR.

It feels like growth. It looks like growth. It gets celebrated in every team meeting.

But if churn is eating it faster than you're adding it — you're on a treadmill, not a growth curve.

Here's the math most teams don't run:

If you're adding $50K MRR every month but losing $40K to churn, your real growth is $10K/month.

Fix churn from 4% to 2% monthly — without adding a single new customer — and you effectively double your net growth.

Retention is the growth lever most teams never actually touch.

**Where companies go wrong:**

They treat the customer journey as ending at the sale.

Onboarding is underfunded. Success check-ins are sporadic. Expansion revenue is an afterthought.

The acquisition team gets bonuses. The retention team gets ignored.

**What high-retention businesses do differently:**

1/ They define success from the customer's perspective, not the company's. Not "contract signed" — but "outcome achieved."

2/ They have a 30/60/90 day activation framework. Not just onboarding emails — actual human touchpoints.

3/ They track NPS and act on it. Not as a vanity exercise. They call the detractors.

The brands I've seen grow fastest in fintech and SaaS aren't the ones with the biggest acquisition budgets.

They're the ones who stopped the bleeding first.

You can't acquire your way out of a retention problem.
