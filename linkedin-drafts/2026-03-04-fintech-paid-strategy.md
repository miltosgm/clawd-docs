# March 4 — How Fintech Brands Win on Paid Without Burning Budget

---

Fintech paid advertising is one of the hardest channels to get right.

High CPCs. Heavy compliance restrictions. Skeptical audiences.

Most brands respond by spending more.

Wrong answer.

Here's what actually works 👇

**The problem with most fintech paid strategies:**

They're product-first.

"Get 5% APY." "Zero fees." "AI-powered portfolio management."

These messages target people who already know what they want.

That's maybe 3% of your addressable market.

**What changes when you go education-first:**

Instead of "Here's our product," the message becomes "Here's what you should know."

Content ads. Explainers. Comparison guides.

You reach people before they're ready to buy — and you become the brand they trust when they are.

**The fintech brands I've seen scale paid efficiently do 3 things differently:**

1/ They segment by financial identity, not just demographics. A 32-year-old making $80K who just got promoted thinks completely differently about money than one who just had their first child.

2/ They use paid to amplify content, not just push product. Their top-performing ads link to an article or a tool, not a sign-up page.

3/ They build retargeting audiences aggressively. Fintech buyers research for weeks. They win by being the brand that follows the buyer through that journey.

The brands burning budget are selling too early to the wrong audience.

The ones winning are patiently building trust — at scale.
