## Post

AI search engines don't just read your content.

They decide if you're worth recommending.

There's a structure to how they make that decision. I call it **Answer Architecture.**

Here's the framework 👇

**The 5 layers AI engines evaluate:**

**1/ Clarity of Position**

❌ "We help businesses grow"  
✅ "We help B2B SaaS companies scale from $1M to $10M ARR"

AI engines favor specificity. If you serve everyone, you serve no one in their answers.

**2/ Evidence Structure**

AI looks for proof:
• Case studies with real numbers
• Third-party validation (reviews, press, citations)
• Consistent messaging across sources

One website = claim  
Multiple trusted sources = fact

**3/ Question-Answer Format**

Structure content around actual questions:

"What should SaaS companies do at $2M ARR?"  
"How do I reduce CAC without cutting budget?"  
"When is the right time to hire a CMO?"

AI engines parse these. Write like you're answering real queries.

**4/ Context Depth**

Surface-level content loses.

AI rewards depth:
• Why something works, not just what
• When to use Strategy A vs Strategy B
• Trade-offs, not just benefits

Think: "comprehensive resource" not "quick tip"

**5/ External Authority Signals**

Your website alone isn't enough.

AI cross-references:
• Industry directories
• Review platforms (G2, Clutch, Trustpilot)
• Guest posts on reputable sites
• Podcast appearances
• Speaking engagements

The more places AI finds your name with credibility, the more it trusts you.

**Put it together:**

Answer Architecture = Position + Evidence + Format + Depth + Authority

**Why this matters:**

When someone asks ChatGPT "Who should I hire for X?" — it's not showing 10 options.

It's showing 1-3 recommendations.

If your Answer Architecture is weak, you're not in that list.

**Action step:**

Pick one service you offer. Write one 1,000-word resource that:
1. Clearly defines who it's for
2. Answers a real question your audience asks
3. Includes specific examples and data
4. Links to external proof (case studies, reviews)

That's Answer Architecture.

And it's how you get chosen, not just found.
