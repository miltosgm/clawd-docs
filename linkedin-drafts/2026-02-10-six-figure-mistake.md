## Post

Three years ago I burned $100K on a "growth" campaign.

I was certain it would work.

The strategy was sound. The messaging was tested. The audience was perfect.

By month 2, I knew it was failing.

By month 3, I killed it.

Took the L.

Here's what that mistake taught me 👇

**The setup:**

We were targeting premium e-commerce brands. High AOV. Wealthy audience.

Strategy: Luxury positioning + scarcity messaging.

Budget: $100K over 90 days.

Expected ROI: 3:1 minimum.

Actual ROI: 0.8:1 (we lost money).

**Where I went wrong:**

Not one thing. Multiple compounding mistakes:

1. **Assumed our model applied to this vertical**
   - Our system worked for SaaS
   - Doesn't mean it works for e-commerce
   - Different buyer psychology entirely

2. **Didn't validate before scaling**
   - Should have tested with $5K first
   - Should have waited for proof
   - Instead: went straight to $100K

3. **Got attached to the strategy**
   - Data said stop in week 4
   - I kept going "just one more week"
   - Sunk cost fallacy is real

4. **Ignored my instinct**
   - Early signals were wrong
   - Low quality leads
   - But I rationalized it away

**What changed:**

This failure made me *religious* about:

✅ Never assume. Always test first.
✅ Small experiments before big bets.
✅ Kill fast when data says stop.
✅ Trust your instinct + data equally.
✅ Document what failed, why, and what we learned.

**The real cost:**

$100K was expensive. But the lesson was worth it.

Now I see founders making similar mistakes daily. Burning 5-6 figures on untested assumptions.

The difference: they don't learn fast enough.

**What I tell founders now:**

If you're going to fail, fail cheap.

Test for $1K-5K before you bet $100K.

You'll lose some money either way. But you'll lose less and learn faster.

**Your biggest mistake?**

DM me. No judgment.

I've made them all.

The founders who talk about their failures are the ones who don't repeat them.
