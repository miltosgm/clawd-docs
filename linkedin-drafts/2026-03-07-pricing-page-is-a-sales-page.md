# March 7 — Your Pricing Page Is Your Most Important Sales Page. Treat It Like One.

---

Most B2B companies treat their pricing page as an afterthought.

A grid of plans. Some checkmarks. A "Contact Sales" button.

Then they wonder why 80% of visitors who hit pricing never convert.

Here's what your pricing page is actually doing:

It's the moment of maximum intent in your entire funnel.

The visitor clicked to pricing. They're considering you. They want to know if you're worth it.

This is not the time for a table. This is the time to sell.

**What high-converting pricing pages do differently:**

1/ They handle the objection before the user has it. Every plan has a sentence that explains who it's for and why the price is justified. Not features — outcomes. "Ideal for teams ready to scale past $1M ARR."

2/ They anchor. You don't want people to see your $500/month plan and think "expensive." You want them to see it next to the $1,500 plan and think "this is the smart choice." Framing determines perception.

3/ They reduce friction at the bottom. The CTA isn't just "Start Free Trial." It's accompanied by: no credit card required, setup in 5 minutes, cancel anytime. Every objection that would make someone hesitate — answer it right there.

4/ They add social proof near the price. Not on the homepage. Right next to the number. A logo, a quote, a data point. "Teams like Stripe use this plan."

The pricing page isn't where you show off features. It's where you close.

Most SaaS companies spend 10x more time on their hero section than their pricing page.

The conversion math doesn't support that decision.
