# March 6 — Everyone Abandoned Email. That's Exactly Why You Should Use It.

---

2023: "Email is dying. Use social."
2024: Algorithm changes tanked organic reach on every platform.
2025: Marketers flooded back to email.

Some things go out of fashion. Email just goes on.

Here's why I've been doubling down on email for fintech and B2B clients when every other agency is pitching TikTok strategies:

**Email has something social lost:**

Ownership.

Your LinkedIn followers? LinkedIn owns them.
Your Instagram audience? Instagram owns them.
Your email list? You own it. Forever. Even if the platform disappears tomorrow.

**What actually works right now:**

Most email programs fail because they treat email like a broadcast channel.

"Here's our newsletter. Here's our product update. Here's our quarterly report."

Nobody asked for any of that.

The email programs that perform well right now do one thing differently: they treat email like a conversation between two people.

One idea per email. Plain text or near-plain text. A question at the end.

Open rates for clients who made this switch: up 40-60%.

Reply rates — which tell you the audience is actually reading — went from under 0.5% to 2-4%.

**The compounding effect:**

Social reach is rented. It decays the moment you stop paying (with money or content).

Email compounds. A list you built 3 years ago is still active. Still valuable. Still yours.

The brands that ignored email for the last 5 years are now starting from zero.

The ones who kept building have an asset.

When did you last treat your email list like an actual asset?
