# March 8 — Founder-Led Content Outperforms Brand Content Every Time. Here's Why.

---

I ran an experiment last year with two fintech clients.

Same budget. Same targeting. Same platforms.

One ran brand content — polished graphics, company logo front and center, professional tone.

One ran founder-led content — the CEO talking about what they're learning, what's hard, what they've gotten wrong.

At 90 days:

Brand content: CPL $420, 18 leads.
Founder content: CPL $91, 67 leads.

Same budget. 3.7x more leads. At a fraction of the cost.

**Why does this keep happening?**

Because people don't trust brands. They trust people.

When a logo talks at you, you scroll past.
When a person talks to you, you listen.

The founder story has something no brand campaign can manufacture: authenticity. Real experience. Real stakes. Real perspective.

**What makes founder content work:**

It's not just posting. It's a specific type of content.

The founder shares what they've learned — not what they want to sell.

They talk about failures, pivots, decisions that didn't work out as expected. The moments that make the audience think "I've felt that too."

That recognition creates trust. Trust creates pipeline.

**The practical version for busy founders:**

10 minutes, three times per week.
Voice note your thoughts on the commute.
Have your team or an AI turn it into a post.
Review, approve, post.

You don't need to write. You need to be willing to be real.

Is your company's face a logo — or a person?
