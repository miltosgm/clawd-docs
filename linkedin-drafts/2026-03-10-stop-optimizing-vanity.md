But pipeline is flat.

Welcome to the vanity metrics trap — and it's more common than anyone admits.

Vanity metrics feel like progress. They're easy to report in dashboards. They make clients and stakeholders feel good.

But they're measuring activity, not outcomes.

**The difference:**

Vanity metric: 15,000 people saw our post.
Signal metric: 47 people clicked through to our tool and 12 booked a call.

Vanity metric: Email open rate 45%.
Signal metric: Reply rate 2.8% and 9 conversations opened this week.

Vanity metric: Our CPC dropped to $0.80.
Signal metric: Our CPL is $280 and 30% of leads close.

**What I ask every client before touching a campaign:**

"If this metric doubled tomorrow but revenue didn't move — would you still care about it?"

If the answer is yes, it's a vanity metric. It might still matter as a proxy — but it shouldn't be the primary goal.

**The harder question:**

Most teams track vanity metrics not because they're lazy — but because the real metrics are harder to attribute.

Pipeline influence is messy. Brand impact takes 6 months to show up. Content ROI is hard to tie to a deal.

So people default to what's easy to count.

The best marketers I know track both — but optimize for outcomes, not activity.
