# Feb 18 — Branded Search Is Dying

---

People used to Google your brand name to find you.

Now they ask ChatGPT what you do.

These are very different things.

Here's what's changing 👇

**Old search intent:**
• "Growth-onomics" → click the website → learn more
• Controlled by your SEO + homepage copy

**New search intent:**
• "Who's good at AEO in Europe?" → ChatGPT gives a list
• Controlled by what the internet says *about* you

The brands that win branded search were doing SEO.

The brands that win AI search are getting written about, cited, referenced.

One is inbound.

The other is *reputation*.

Here's the thing most marketing teams are missing:

You can't optimize your way into an AI recommendation.

You earn it — through thought leadership, press mentions, client results, third-party validation.

➡️ The brands winning in AI search look more like PR plays than SEO plays.

If your marketing is still 80% owned content and 20% earned media, that ratio is backwards now.

Flip it.
