# March 11 — B2B Paid and B2C Paid Are Not the Same Game

---

I've watched good marketers fail badly because they brought B2C instincts to a B2B campaign.

And the reverse.

The strategies aren't just different in execution. They're different at the fundamental level of how buyers behave.

**B2C paid:**

Decision is personal. Often emotional. Buying cycle: minutes to days.

You're appealing to one person. Their desire, their fear, their identity. The best B2C ads feel like a mirror.

Offer simplicity works: "30% off. Buy now. Free shipping."

**B2B paid:**

Decision is organizational. Often rational (on the surface). Buying cycle: weeks to months.

You're reaching multiple stakeholders. The person who clicks the ad isn't always the person who signs the contract. Sometimes they're not even in the same department.

"30% off. Buy now" is meaningless when someone needs internal sign-off, a procurement process, and a security review.

**The mistake B2C-trained marketers make in B2B:**

They optimize for click-through. Fast conversion. Short funnel.

But a B2B buyer who downloads a whitepaper, attends a webinar, reads your case study, and then books a demo 60 days later is a better lead than someone who impulsively clicked "Start Free Trial."

The intent signals look different. The conversion windows are longer. The attribution is murkier.

**The mistake B2B-trained marketers make in B2C:**

They overthink it. Long-form ad copy. Educational tone. Overly rational messaging.

B2C buyers don't want to be educated. They want to be moved.

Both disciplines are learnable. But you have to know which game you're playing before you set up the campaign.
