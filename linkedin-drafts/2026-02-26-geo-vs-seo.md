# Feb 26 — GEO Is Not SEO With a New Name

---

Everyone keeps saying "GEO is the new SEO."

They're wrong.

SEO is about getting found. GEO is about being cited.

These are completely different problems.

Here's what that actually means 👇

**In traditional SEO:**
• You rank on a results page
• User clicks your link
• You get the traffic

**In GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):**
• AI reads thousands of sources
• Synthesizes an answer
• Cites 2-3 it considers authoritative

You don't get a click. You get a recommendation.

Or you get nothing.

The criteria AI uses to cite a source are not the same as Google's ranking signals.

Authority matters. But so does clarity, specificity, and how well your content matches the question being asked.

Keyword density is irrelevant.
Structured answers are everything.

Here's the shift most brands are missing:

Your homepage won't get cited.
Your "Ultimate Guide to X" probably will.

Deep, specific, well-structured content wins in AI search.
Thin, keyword-stuffed pages become invisible.

**What to focus on right now:**

1/ Write to answer questions, not to rank for terms

2/ Structure content with clear H2s that match how people ask AI questions

3/ Build E-E-A-T signals aggressively — AI cites credible sources

4/ Create content that demonstrates lived experience, not just research

One thing is clear:

The brands investing in GEO now will be uncatchable in 18 months.

The ones waiting to "see how it plays out" won't have time to catch up.

Is your content strategy already built for AI search — or still optimized for 2019?
