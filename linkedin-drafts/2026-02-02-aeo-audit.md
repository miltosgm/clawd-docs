## Topic: AEO Self-Audit (drives to lead magnet)

---

I asked ChatGPT to recommend marketing agencies in Cyprus.

Growth-onomics came up. Most competitors didn't.

This isn't luck. It's AEO.

Here's a 2-minute audit to see where you stand 👇

---

**1/ Search your brand in ChatGPT and Perplexity**

Ask: "What is [your company] known for?"

If it doesn't know you — or gets it wrong — you have a visibility problem.

**2/ Search your category**

Ask: "Best [your service] companies in [your market]"

Are you mentioned? Are competitors? This reveals your AI search position.

**3/ Check your content structure**

AI loves clear answers. Look at your top pages:

• Do they answer specific questions?
• Are they structured with headers and lists?
• Is there a clear summary AI can extract?

**4/ Audit your citations**

Where does AI get its information? Check:

• Are you mentioned on Wikipedia, industry publications?
• Do you appear in Reddit/Quora discussions?
• Are you cited by sites AI trusts?

---

Most brands score 1/4 or worse.

The ones dominating AI search? They've been building this for 12+ months.

The window is still open. But not for long.
