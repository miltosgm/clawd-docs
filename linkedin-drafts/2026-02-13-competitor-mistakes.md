## Post

I spent an hour analyzing competitor landing pages yesterday.

Most of them are leaving 40-60% of potential revenue on the table.

Not because their product is bad. Because their acquisition strategy is stuck in 2021.

Here's what they're all getting wrong 👇

**#1: The Generic Hero Section**

Competitor landing pages all say the same thing:

"The #1 platform for [generic benefit]"
"Transform your business with our solution"
"Join 10,000+ happy customers"

Meanwhile, visitors have 6 seconds to decide.

Nobody remembers generic.

**What's working instead:**

Specific, immediate value:

"Stop losing 30% of your leads to slow follow-up"
"Get 40% more demos without hiring sales reps"
"Land 3x more enterprise deals in 90 days"

Real benefit > vague benefit. Always.

**#2: No Social Proof Strategy**

Their testimonials are:

"Great platform!" - CEO, Company Name
"Love it!" - Manager, Another Company

Generic fluff. No specificity. Zero credibility.

**What works:**

Specific outcomes + real context:

"Cut our CPA by 52% in 6 months." - VP Growth, $50M SaaS company
"Generated 340 qualified leads." - Marketing Director, HR Tech, Month 1
"3.8x ROAS on paid advertising." - Performance Director, E-commerce brand

Notice: outcome + role + context + time.

That builds trust.

**#3: Missing the Audience Segmentation**

They have ONE call-to-action: "Start Free Trial"

But their audience is:
- Bootstrapped founders (want cheap)
- Fortune 500 companies (want premium support)
- Agencies (want reseller pricing)
- Freelancers (want pay-as-you-go)

Treating everyone the same = average results for everyone.

**What wins:**

Segment the hero + CTAs:

"For founders: $49/month. No credit card."
"For enterprises: Custom pricing + dedicated support."
"For agencies: White-label + volume discounts."

Each audience sees what they need. Conversions jump.

**#4: The "Feature List" Trap**

They list 47 features. Nobody reads it.

People care about ONE thing: "What's in it for me?"

**What they should show:**

Instead of: "AI-powered analytics dashboard"

Show: "Know your top-performing campaign in 30 seconds"

Instead of: "Advanced segmentation engine"

Show: "Target only your most profitable customers"

Features solve problems. Lead with the problem + solution, not the feature.

**#5: No Trust Signal Architecture**

They have:
- Logo wall (looks desperate)
- Random testimonial (not credible without context)
- Trust badges (doesn't prove anything)

Missing: actual evidence that this works.

**What builds real trust:**

- Case study with specific metrics
- Before/After comparison with data
- Free audit or assessment (let them experience value first)
- Guarantee or money-back promise
- Customer results dashboard (show live wins)

**Why this matters:**

Your competitors aren't bad at conversion. They're just lazy.

They copy what everyone else is doing instead of testing what actually works.

That leaves a gap. A gap you can fill.

The company that gets customer acquisition right wins the market.

**What competitor mistake are you seeing that frustrates you?**

Drop it below. I'll share the fix.

## Notes
- Specific, actionable breakdown
- Shows gaps in competitor strategy
- Each point has "wrong" vs "right" framing
- Positions Miltos as conversion expert
- Invites engagement with specific ask
- Contrarian (not just marketing hype)
- Relatable (everyone sees competitors doing this)
