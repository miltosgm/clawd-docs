## Post

40% of professionals now use ChatGPT as their primary search engine.

That's not a prediction. That's December 2025 data.

If you're still optimizing only for Google, you're invisible to nearly half your audience.

Here's what the numbers tell us 👇

**The shift is real:**
• 2023: "AI search is interesting"
• 2024: "AI search is coming"
• 2025: "AI search is here"
• 2026: It's the default for decision-makers

**Why 40% matters:**

It's the tipping point.

When 40% of your target market changes behavior, the other 60% follows fast.

We saw it with mobile. We saw it with social media. We're seeing it now with AI search.

**The 3 types of businesses right now:**

1/ **The Invisible** — Not showing up in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude
→ Losing deals they don't even know about

2/ **The Mentioned** — Show up sometimes, no context, no authority
→ Getting passed over for competitors who appear more credible

3/ **The Chosen** — Consistently recommended with context and trust signals
→ Capturing the 40% (and growing)

**Here's the thing:**

Most businesses still treat AI search as "future planning."

It's not future. It's *now.*

Your competitor who ranks in ChatGPT's answers? They're closing deals while you're optimizing meta descriptions.

**What separates The Chosen from The Invisible:**

• Authority content that AI engines trust
• Structured data AI can parse
• Brand mentions across credible sources
• Clear positioning (specialists win over generalists)

If traditional Search was about being found, AI Search is about being chosen.

The 40% are already choosing. Are they choosing you?
