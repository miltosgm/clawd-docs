## Post

We spent 90 days optimizing one client's campaigns.

The results were solid:
• 52% lower CPA
• 3.8x ROAS improvement
• 67% increase in qualified leads

But here's what really changed the game:

We documented everything.

**Not just the numbers.**

The decisions. The pivots. The failures. The "why" behind every change.

That case study has generated more business than the actual campaign results.

Here's why 👇

**Most agencies hide their process.**

They show you the "before and after."

They don't show you:
• What they tested that failed
• How they diagnosed the real problem
• Why they chose Strategy B over Strategy A
• The data that drove each decision

**We did the opposite.**

We made the case study a playbook.

**The result:**

Prospects read it and think: "This is exactly how I need someone to approach MY business."

Not: "Wow, great numbers" (generic).

But: "I understand how they think" (trust).

**The difference between good and great case studies:**

❌ **Good:** "We increased conversions by 150%"  
✅ **Great:** "Here's the hypothesis we tested, the data we tracked, and why Month 2 almost made us quit"

❌ **Good:** "Our client is happy"  
✅ **Great:** "Here's the email our client sent after Month 3 (with their permission)"

❌ **Good:** "We used advanced targeting"  
✅ **Great:** "We narrowed from 14 audiences to 3. Here's the matrix we used to decide."

**Why this works:**

People don't buy results. They buy *understanding*.

When they see your process, they trust you can apply it to their situation.

**What we learned:**

The case study that shows your thinking beats the case study that shows your numbers.

Every time.

**Your turn:**

If you've delivered results for a client, document it.

Not as a brag. As a teaching moment.

The businesses that learn from you will become your next clients.
