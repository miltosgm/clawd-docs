# March 5 — Your Traffic Didn't Drop. Your Visibility Strategy Did.

---

A client came to me in October with a problem.

Organic traffic down 30% year-over-year.

SEO "looked fine." Rankings were holding. Nothing broken in Search Console.

So where did the traffic go?

Answer: Google kept it.

AI Overviews — those generated answer blocks at the top of search results — now handle millions of queries that used to send clicks to websites.

The user gets the answer. They never click.

**This is the new reality:**

Google is no longer a referral engine. It's becoming the destination.

If your content is only built to rank — and not to be the source that AI pulls from — you're invisible in the places that matter most.

**What we changed:**

1/ Restructured key pages as direct-answer content. Not "here's everything we know about X." But "here is the precise answer to what you're asking about X."

2/ Added structured data everywhere. FAQ schema. How-to schema. Definitions.

3/ Shifted KPIs. Stopped reporting on clicks alone. Started tracking branded search volume, direct traffic, and pipeline attribution.

Within 90 days: traffic was still flat. But qualified pipeline was up 22%.

Traffic isn't the goal. Pipeline is.

Some of your competitors are losing sleep over their traffic numbers.

You should be losing sleep over whether AI knows who you are.

Is your content built to rank — or built to be referenced?
