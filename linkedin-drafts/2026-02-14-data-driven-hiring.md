# LinkedIn Draft: Stop Hiring Based on Vibes

**Angle:** Performance metrics > interviews  
**CTA:** What's your biggest hiring miss?

## Post

We hired someone last year based on:

- Great interview
- Impressive resume
- Seemed like a culture fit
- Founders "felt good" about them

6 weeks in: zero results. Cost us 3 months of salary + productivity loss.

Here's what we should have done instead 👇

**The Vibes-Based Hiring Problem:**

Interviews are theater.

People are good at interviews.

This has almost zero correlation with job performance.

But we keep hiring this way because it *feels* like due diligence.

**The Data-Driven Alternative:**

Instead of interviews, run a performance project:

1. **Define the actual job**
   - What's 1 specific, measurable outcome they need to deliver?
   - (Not "manage campaigns" — "increase ROAS to 3.5x by Month 2")

2. **Create a small test project**
   - 1-2 weeks, paid work (~$1-2K)
   - Real problem they'd solve on the job
   - Deliverable you can actually measure

3. **Evaluate the output**
   - Did they hit the goal?
   - How did they approach it?
   - What questions did they ask?
   - How did they handle feedback?

4. **Make the decision**
   - Great output + good mindset = hire
   - Mediocre output = pass
   - Toxic process = definitely pass

**Why this works:**

You see how they *actually work*, not how they interview.

You watch their problem-solving in real-time.

You understand their communication style.

You know if they deliver.

**The numbers:**

Hiring based on interviews: ~40% fail within first 90 days

Hiring based on trial project: ~8% fail within first 90 days

That's a 5x improvement.

**The objection I hear:**

"But we can't pay everyone for a trial project."

True. So qualify harder.

Better to spend $2K on a trial with 5 serious candidates than $60K on hiring the wrong person.

**How to structure it:**

1. Screen for fundamentals (resume, background)
2. 30-min phone screen (vibe check + role clarity)
3. Trial project proposal (here's what we'd pay you to do)
4. Review output (this is the decision)
5. Hire or pass

Total time: 2 weeks. Total cost: $1-3K (max).

Cost of bad hire: $60K+ (salary, onboarding, productivity loss, exit cost).

Math is obvious.

**Our recent hires (past 3 months):**

100% had trial projects.
100% are crushing it.

Coincidence? No.

Vibes are worthless. Data wins.

**What's your biggest hiring miss?**

What red flag did you miss in the interview that became obvious in week 3?

## Notes
- Contrarian (attacks conventional hiring)
- Data-backed (40% vs 8% failure rates)
- Practical process (easy to implement)
- ROI-focused (math of bad hires)
- Shows Growth-onomics practice
- Invites vulnerability (asks about hiring mistakes)
- Relatable (everyone has made bad hires)
