# Feb 19 — The Client Who Refused AEO

---

A client came to us 14 months ago.

We told them AEO was the next big shift. AI search was coming fast. They needed to act now.

Their response: "We'll wait and see."

So we focused on traditional SEO. Did solid work. Rankings improved.

Then something shifted.

6 months later, their traffic started dropping — not their rankings.

CTR was down 40% on positions they still held.

Why? AI Overviews. ChatGPT answers. Perplexity summaries.

People were getting answers without clicking.

We went back to them. Same conversation. This time they listened.

Here's what we built:

1/ **Structured content** around the questions their buyers actually ask
2/ **Authority signals** — more external citations, expert quotes, data-backed claims
3/ **Answer-first formatting** — conclusions before explanations
4/ **Schema markup** for every FAQ and how-to

8 weeks later, they were showing up in AI answers for their 3 core topics.

The window is still open.

But it's closing.

The brands building AI presence *now* will be impossible to displace in 12 months.

Waiting to see is a strategy. Just not a good one.

If you're still "watching how this plays out," what exactly are you waiting for?
