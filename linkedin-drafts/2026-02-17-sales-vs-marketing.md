## Post

The oldest conversation at growth companies:

Marketing: "Sales isn't following up on leads"
Sales: "Marketing's leads are garbage"
CEO: "Why aren't we hitting target?"

Everyone's frustrated. Nobody's right. The system is broken.

Here's how to fix it 👇

**The Root Problem:**

No SLA (Service Level Agreement) between teams.

No definition of what "quality" means.

No metrics that matter.

Result: Both teams optimizing for different things.

**Example:**

Marketing says: "We got 500 leads this month"

Sales says: "Most of them are worthless"

Both are right.

Marketing optimized for volume. Sales needs qualified leads.

Different targets = different behaviors = conflict.

**The SLA Framework:**

**1. Define lead quality together**

Not marketing alone. Not sales alone. Together.

"A qualified lead is:"
- Specific role (VP Growth, not "hiring manager")
- Right company size ($5M-$50M ARR, not startup or enterprise)
- Active buying signal (opened 3+ emails, visited pricing page)
- Timeline to decision (buying in next 60 days, not someday)
- Budget authority (can approve, not evaluating)

Write this down. Agree on it.

**2. Create handoff metrics**

Marketing delivers:
- [X leads per month]
- [Y% meet quality criteria]
- [Z% convert to sales calls]

Sales commits to:
- Call back within [X hours]
- Qualify or disqualify within [X days]
- Provide feedback on lead quality

Both teams now have accountability.

**3. Measure what matters**

Not just revenue (too slow to adjust).

Measure pipeline movement:

- Marketing → Sales: [leads generated]
- Sales → Meeting: [% that convert to meeting]
- Meeting → Opportunity: [% that convert to opp]
- Opportunity → Deal: [% that close]

Where's the biggest drop-off?

That's where to optimize.

**Real example:**

Company A:

- Marketing: 500 leads/month
- Sales: 50% conversion to meeting
- Meeting: 30% conversion to opportunity
- Opportunity: 20% close rate
- Result: 1,500 revenue per month

Company B (same marketing):

- Marketing: 500 leads/month
- Sales: 80% conversion to meeting (better qualification)
- Meeting: 40% conversion to opportunity (better pitch)
- Opportunity: 35% close rate (better negotiation)
- Result: 5,600 revenue per month

Same leads. 3.7x better outcome.

**What usually happens:**

No SLA → Marketing generates bad leads → Sales blames marketing → Marketing increases volume to compensate → Sales gets buried → Nobody follows up → leads go cold → everyone blames each other.

**What should happen:**

1. Agree on lead definition
2. Marketing qualifies better, delivers fewer but better leads
3. Sales follows up faster, qualifies tighter
4. Both teams track conversion rates
5. Both teams optimize their piece
6. Revenue compounds

**The uncomfortable truth:**

Most revenue problems aren't "not enough leads."

They're "not enough follow-up" or "not enough conversion."

But it's easier to blame marketing for "low quality" than to fix your sales process.

**Getting this right:**

1. Create a simple SLA (1 page)
2. Both teams sign off
3. Track the metrics weekly
4. Review together monthly
5. Adjust based on data

**What's your biggest sales/marketing disconnect?**

Is it volume, quality, follow-up, or something else?
