# Feb 25 — The Next 6 Months in Digital Marketing

---

Predictions are easy. Most are wrong.

Here's what I'm actually seeing on the ground — in client campaigns, proposals, and conversations.

**What's accelerating:**

AI search is eating informational queries faster than anyone expected.

"How to" content is being answered in-platform. Clicks don't follow.

The brands responding by building AI presence are already pulling ahead.

**What's collapsing:**

Generic content. Thin blog posts. SEO articles written to rank, not to inform.

If your content strategy was built around volume, you're feeling it.

**What's surprising:**

Long-form is back — but not for SEO reasons.

Readers want depth when they care about something. And AI summaries are driving them to longer content to verify the answer.

Counter-intuitive? Yes. True? Also yes.

**What's still underrated:**

Email. Communities. Podcasts. Human-to-human channels.

The more AI mediates discovery, the more people trust human recommendations.

Own a channel you control. Build an audience that chose you directly.

**What I'd bet on:**

The next 6 months belong to brands that invest in being *cited* — not just found.

Authority signals. Earned media. Real expertise on the record.

The algorithm doesn't matter if you're the source.
