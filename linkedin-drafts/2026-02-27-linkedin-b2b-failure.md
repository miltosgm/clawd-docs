# Feb 27 — Why Most B2B LinkedIn Strategies Fail

---

Most B2B brands treat LinkedIn like a press release channel.

They post company updates.
Announce new hires.
Share awards they won.

And then wonder why no one engages.

Here's the problem 👇

No one follows a brand to hear about the brand.

They follow people. They read content that teaches them something or challenges how they think.

Your logo cannot do that. Your people can.

**What actually works in B2B LinkedIn right now:**

1/ **Founder-led content** — The CEO/CGO sharing what they see in the market, not what the company does. Raw, specific, opinionated.

2/ **Behind-the-decision content** — "We almost signed this client, here's why we didn't." Real stakes, real thinking.

3/ **Documented case studies** — Not "we achieved X for client Y." Instead: "here's the exact problem, the exact strategy, and what we'd do differently."

4/ **Contrarian takes** — Challenge what your industry takes for granted. Be right, but say the unpopular thing.

What doesn't work:

• Company announcements
• Thought leadership written by committee
• Posts that sound like press releases
• Anything requiring 3 approvals

Here's the thing:

Your competitors are still posting company news.

That's your opening.

One founder with a strong point of view will outperform a corporate LinkedIn page 100% of the time.

Stop hiding behind the logo.
