# Feb 24 — Dark Social Is Your Biggest Attribution Problem

---

A prospect messages your sales team: "I heard good things about you."

Your CRM says: source = direct.

Your team assumes: referral, maybe word of mouth.

What actually happened: they saw 4 of your LinkedIn posts, read a blog article, watched a YouTube clip, then searched your brand.

You'll never know.

That's dark social. And it's responsible for more B2B deals than most companies realize.

Here's the problem with modern attribution 👇

Last-click models give 100% credit to Google.

But the decision was made in a Slack DM, a WhatsApp group, a LinkedIn comments thread, or a private conversation.

These touchpoints are invisible to your analytics.

**What you can do:**

1/ Ask every new client: "How did you hear about us?" — and actually record the answer

2/ Add "How did you find us?" to your intake form with space for a real answer, not a dropdown

3/ Track which content gets shared in DMs (not just public engagement)

4/ Build your presence in the places your buyers hang out *privately* — niche communities, newsletters, podcasts

**The insight:**

If your pipeline is healthy but your attribution looks confusing — dark social is working.

Don't optimize it away. Invest more into the channels you can't fully track.

Because that's where trust is actually built.
