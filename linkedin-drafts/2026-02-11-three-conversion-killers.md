## Post

I audited 23 e-commerce sites last month.

All of them had conversion problems.

None of them were hard to fix.

They just weren't looking in the right places.

Here are the three killers I found on almost every site 👇

**#1: The "Friction Black Hole" Checkout**

Your product page is beautiful. Testimonials are solid. Add-to-cart rate is decent.

Then: 64% of people abandon at checkout.

Usually because:

❌ 4+ form fields you don't need
❌ Asking for account creation (kill this)
❌ Surprise shipping costs at the end
❌ No guest checkout option
❌ Trust signals missing (SSL badge, money-back guarantee)

**Fix:** Cut form fields to 3. Add guest checkout. Show shipping early.

Expected lift: 18-23% improvement.

**#2: The "Wrong Audience, Wrong Message" Campaign**

You're targeting the right people. But your ad creative doesn't match their actual need.

Examples:

❌ Luxury positioning to budget-conscious audience
❌ "Join 100K+ users" when they want niche/exclusive
❌ Speed messaging when they want quality
❌ Enterprise copy to small businesses ("Scales to millions of users" = not for me)

**Fix:** Segment your audience. Customize messaging. Test 3 different angles.

Expected lift: 25-40% improvement.

**#3: The "Invisible Value Prop" Homepage**

Visitor lands on your homepage. They have 8 seconds to understand what you do and if it's for them.

Most sites waste this:

❌ Clever wordplay instead of clarity
❌ "We help companies grow" (generic)
❌ No mention of specific result (time saved? money made? risk removed?)
❌ No clear CTA above the fold
❌ Visual doesn't match the value prop

**Fix:** Lead with the specific result. Show who it's for. One clear CTA.

Example:

BEFORE: "AI-powered solutions for your business"

AFTER: "Cut your customer acquisition costs by 40% in 90 days or your money back"

Expected lift: 30-45% improvement.

**How to audit your own:**

1. Open your site with fresh eyes
2. Ask: "In 8 seconds, do I know what this does?"
3. Check your checkout (count the form fields)
4. Review your ad creative (does it match the audience?)
5. Fix the worst offender first

Usually, the lowest-hanging fruit has the biggest impact.
