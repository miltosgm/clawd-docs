## Post

Meta descriptions are dead.

Title tags? Don't matter much either.

Keyword density? AI engines laugh at that.

If you're still optimizing for 2015 SEO, you're invisible to the search engines that actually drive decisions in 2026.

Here's what AI engines care about 👇

**Not this:**
❌ Meta keywords
❌ Alt text stuffed with keywords
❌ 500 words minimum
❌ "SEO-friendly URLs"
❌ H1 tag optimization

**This:**

✅ **Context over keywords** — Does your content answer WHY, not just WHAT?

✅ **Source credibility** — Are you cited by sources AI trusts? (Think: industry publications, research papers, reputable directories)

✅ **Conversational language** — Write how people ask questions, not how they type keywords

✅ **Structured data** — Schema markup, clear headings, FAQ sections AI can parse

✅ **Specificity** — "Best for SaaS companies scaling $1M-$10M ARR" beats "best marketing agency"

**Here's what changed:**

Google Search: You compete for position #1 in a list.

AI Search: You compete to BE the answer.

There is no position #2 when ChatGPT gives one recommendation.

**The shift in one example:**

**Old SEO:**  
"Digital marketing agency Cyprus | SEO services | PPC management"

**AI Search:**  
"We help B2B SaaS companies scale from $1M to $10M ARR using Answer Engine Optimization. Our clients show up in ChatGPT, not just Google."

See the difference?

One is optimized for crawlers. The other is optimized for intelligence.

**What to do:**

1/ Stop writing for algorithms. Write for humans (because AI now understands humans).

2/ Focus on authority signals, not ranking signals.

3/ Be specific about WHO you help and HOW. Generalists lose in AI search.

4/ Build credibility outside your website (third-party mentions matter more than ever).

If you're still stuffing keywords into meta tags, you're playing a game that ended two years ago.

The question isn't "what's my keyword strategy?"

It's "when someone asks AI for help, am I the answer they get?"
