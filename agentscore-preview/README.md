## Running Locally

```bash
# From the website directory
cd /Users/milton/clawd/projects/agent-scraper/website

# Start a local server

## Data Source

The website loads agent data from `../collected-agents.json` which contains:
- Agent name
- Location (city)
- Bazaraki URL
- Number of active listings

Ratings and reviews are generated algorithmically for the MVP. In production, these would come from a database with real reviews.

## Deployment

This is a static site that can be hosted anywhere:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any web server

Just upload all files and ensure `collected-agents.json` is accessible at `../collected-agents.json` relative to the website files.
