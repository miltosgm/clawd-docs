---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Technology Changes Fast
**Mitigation:** Use APIs (ElevenLabs, Resemble) rather than building from scratch. Stay platform-agnostic.

### Risk 2: Big Players Enter Market
**Mitigation:** Focus on niche markets (real estate) where you have expertise and relationships.

### Risk 3: Customers Resist AI
**Mitigation:** Position as "augmentation" not "replacement." Emphasize 24/7 availability, not job elimination.

### Risk 4: High Customer Acquisition Cost
**Mitigation:** Leverage existing network (LinkedIn 16.7K followers) for initial customers. Build case studies for credibility.
