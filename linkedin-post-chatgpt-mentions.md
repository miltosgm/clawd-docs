# How to get your brand mentioned by ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT to recommend the best [industry] companies.

Most brands didn't exist.

Not ranked low. Not mentioned at all.

Meanwhile, a few names kept coming up — again and again.

Here's the difference.

---

ChatGPT doesn't show 10 blue links. It picks one or two sources to cite.

If you're not in that answer, you're invisible.

And your current SEO strategy won't fix it.

Here's why most brands get ignored by AI 👇

---

**>You're not in the sources AI trains on**

LLMs pull from Reddit, Quora, industry publications, and high-authority sites.

If you're not part of those conversations, you don't exist to AI.

**Fix:** Get mentioned in the places AI actually learns from. Not for backlinks — for context.

---

**>Your content is written for Google, not comprehension**

AI doesn't just crawl. It interprets.

Keyword-stuffed pages with no clear structure? Skipped.

**Fix:** Use clear headings, direct answers, and schema markup. Write like you're explaining to a smart person, not gaming an algorithm.

---

**>You have no topical authority**

One blog post won't cut it.

AI looks for depth — 15-20 interconnected pieces around a topic.

**Fix:** Build content clusters. Become the obvious expert in your space.

---

**>You're blocking AI crawlers without knowing it**

GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot — they all behave differently.

Many sites block them by default.

**Fix:** Audit your robots.txt. Make sure AI can actually read your content.

---

The brands figuring this out now will dominate for years.

The ones waiting will wonder why they disappeared from search.

If traditional Search was about being found, AI Search is about being chosen.

The question is: will AI choose you?
