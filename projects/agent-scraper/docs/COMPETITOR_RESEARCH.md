## 3. Local Market Analysis (Cyprus)

### Current Landscape

| Platform | Type | Reviews? | Agent Profiles? |
|----------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Bazaraki.com** | Classifieds | ❌ | Basic only |
| **Home.cy** | Listings | ❌ | Basic only |
| **Cyprus-property.com** | Portal | ❌ | Agency pages |
| **Google Maps** | Reviews | ✅ (scattered) | Via business listing |
| **Facebook** | Reviews | ✅ (scattered) | Via business pages |

### Key Finding: **No Dedicated Agent Review Platform in Cyprus**

This is a significant market gap. Property seekers currently must:
1. Search Google for agency name + "reviews"
2. Check multiple platforms (Google, Facebook, TripAdvisor)
3. Rely on word-of-mouth
4. Trust agency marketing claims
