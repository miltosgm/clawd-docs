## Key Insight

Backlinku's biggest gap isn't features—it's **trust signals**. In a market where people are paying $100-$5000 for links, they need to trust you. Competitors weaponize Trustpilot ratings, video testimonials, and case studies. Backlinku should prioritize these immediately.

The product looks solid. Now it needs social proof to match.
