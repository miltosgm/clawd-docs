# Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agents don't see value | Focus on marketing tools, not just reviews |
| Can't get reviews | Agents collect their own (give them tools) |
| Competition copies | Move fast, build relationships |
| Legal issues | Verify claims, allow agent responses |
| Low conversion to paid | Offer more free value, better premium features |

---

# Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Choose a name** - check domain availability
2. **Validate demand** - call 10 Cyprus agents, pitch the idea
3. **Scrape Cyprus data** - build initial agent database
4. **Wireframe MVP** - sketch the core screens
5. **Decide: build or outsource** - based on budget/skills
