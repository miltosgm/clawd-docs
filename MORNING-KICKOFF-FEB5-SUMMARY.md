## 💡 Why This Matters

Voice AI for dentists is a **$60M TAM** with:
- **10x cheaper** than current solutions
- **Set-and-forget** automation
- **Dental-specific** (not generic)
- **High switching costs** (integrations)
- **Recurring revenue** ($99/month × 5K practices = $495K/month)

Moving from prototype → production integration unblocks real market validation with dental practices. This is the critical path to proving viability.

**Status:** Ready for Miltos to execute Phase 2 ✅
