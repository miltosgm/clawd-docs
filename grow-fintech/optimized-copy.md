## HERO

**H1 (original):** We help fintech companies grow | Profitably.
**H1 (optimized):** We Grow Fintechs. Profitably.
*Why: Cleaner. Faster. "Profitably" lands harder as its own statement.*

**Subhead (original):** Acquisition that scales, demand that converts, and growth you can measure in revenue.
**Subhead (optimized):** Acquisition that scales. Demand that converts. Growth measured in revenue — not reports.
*Why: Rhythm. The "not reports" dig is a trust signal for fintech buyers who've been burned by vanity metrics.*

## PAIN / PROBLEM SECTION

**Intro (original):** Too many fintechs:
**Intro (optimized):** Sound familiar?

**Bullets (original → optimized):**
- Spend aggressively on paid media without clear CAC control → Burn paid budget without CAC guardrails — and wonder why growth stalls
- Rely on outdated SEO and generic content strategies → Run SEO playbooks built for 2019 while buyers find products through AI
- Scale channels without a real GTM or demand engine → Scale broken GTMs and call it growth
- Work with agencies that don't understand fintech economics or buyer journeys → Work with agencies who've never heard of LTV/CAC — and it shows

**Bridge (original):** We fix that.
**Bridge (optimized):** We fix that. Without the excuses.

## SUB-HERO / CREDIBILITY

**Label (original):** Trusted by ambitious fintech teams worldwide
**Label (optimized):** Trusted by fintech teams across payments, lending, crypto, and embedded finance

**Body (original):** We have 7+ years of experience working with fintech teams across all stages...
**Body (optimized):**
7+ years working with fintech teams — from early traction to Series B scale. The questions are always the same:

- Which channels are actually worth scaling?
- Where's budget being wasted?
- What's stopping demand from turning into pipeline?
- How do we grow without breaking unit economics?

That's exactly where we come in.

## WHAT WE DO

**Intro (original):** What we do (and what we don't)
**Intro (optimized):** What We Do — And What We Don't
*Keep the "(and what we don't)" — it's honest and differentiated*

**Body para 1 (optimized):**
We run paid acquisition across Google, LinkedIn, and Meta. But only once the fundamentals align — not as a substitute for strategy.

**Body para 2 — GEO (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR — EXPAND THIS):**
Original: "we help fintech companies adapt to AI-powered discovery..."
Optimized:
Search has changed. Buyers increasingly find products through AI answers — not just search results. Most fintech companies haven't updated their content or visibility strategy to match. We have.

**Body para 3 (optimized):**
We work on growth strategy and GTM when it's needed — because throwing paid media at unclear positioning is the fastest way to burn budget.

**Body para 4 (optimized):**
When teams need senior direction, we act as a fractional CMO or growth partner — helping founders and leadership teams move faster, make better decisions, and avoid expensive mistakes.

## SERVICES

### 1. Paid Acquisition for Fintech
**Original:** We run performance campaigns across Google, LinkedIn, and Meta, built around fintech unit economics instead of generic media plans. Every campaign is designed to answer one question: Can this scale profitably?
**Optimized:** Keep as-is. It's sharp.
*Minor tweak:* "...built around your unit economics — not a generic media plan."

### 2. GEO — Generative Engine Optimization ⚡ LEAN IN
**Section headline (new):** GEO — Generative Engine Optimization
**Intro (optimized):** Search is no longer just search. AI answers are the new first page.
We help fintech brands:
- Get cited in AI-generated answers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews)
- Build content and signals that influence LLM visibility
- Future-proof organic acquisition beyond traditional SEO

*This is a genuine differentiator. Say it louder.*

### 3. Growth Strategy & GTM
**Headline (optimized):** Growth Strategy & GTM
**Body (original):** Before scaling spend, we align: ICP & segmentation / Messaging and positioning / Funnel design / Channel priorities / Because scaling a broken GTM just burns cash faster.
**Optimized:** Keep the structure. Sharpen the kicker:
"Because scaling a broken GTM doesn't fix it — it just burns cash faster."

### 4. B2B Fintech Demand Generation
**Original:** If you sell to businesses or institutions, clicks alone won't cut it. We build demand engines that turn attention into: qualified conversations / real pipeline / revenue you can forecast.
**Optimized:** Keep this verbatim. It's tight and specific.

### 5. Fractional CMO / Growth Advisory
**Original:** Sometimes the problem isn't execution, it's decision-making.
**Optimized:** Keep verbatim. Perfect opening.

## HOW WE MEASURE GROWTH (KEEP 95% AS-IS — IT'S EXCELLENT)

**Original:** We don't optimise for impressions, engagement, or "brand awareness" reports that no one reads.
**Optimized:** We don't optimise for impressions, engagement, or brand awareness reports that nobody reads.
*(Drop the quotes around brand awareness — reads more confident)*

Metrics to keep:
- CAC ✓
- LTV ✓
- Conversion rates ✓
- Pipeline quality ✓
- Revenue contribution ✓

**Kicker (original):** If a channel can't prove its value, it doesn't get scaled. Simple as that.
**Optimized:** Keep verbatim. It's perfect.

## PROCESS (4 STEPS)

**Step names (original → optimized):**
1. Diagnose → **Diagnose** (keep)
2. Design → **Design** (keep)
3. Execute & Optimise → **Execute & Optimise** (keep)
4. Scale What Works → **Scale What Works** (keep — great naming)

**Step 1 (optimized):** We audit your current growth engine — paid, organic, funnel, messaging. No assumptions. Just data.
**Step 2 (optimized):** We build a strategy grounded in data, not best guesses. Clear priorities, clear rationale.
**Step 3 (optimized):** We launch, test, and iterate — constantly improving against metrics that actually matter.
**Step 4 (optimized):** Double down on what's profitable. Kill what doesn't perform. Repeat.
