# Grow Fintech — Homepage Strategy & Copy

---

## PART 1: INSPIRATION ARCHETYPES

### Archetype 1 — "Minimal Premium Studio"
**Think:** Elegant, white-space-heavy, editorial tone. Like a high-end consulting firm that happens to do marketing.
**Visual:** Serif + sans serif pairing, generous whitespace, muted palette with one bold accent
**Messaging:** Understated confidence. No yelling. Lets results speak.
**Borrow:** Trust through restraint. Premium positioning without chest-thumping.
**Avoid:** So minimal it becomes vague. Needs real copy that converts.

### Archetype 2 — "Conversion-First Performance Shop"
**Think:** Dark UI, metrics everywhere, bold claims backed by numbers. Performance agencies.
**Visual:** Dark background, neon/electric accent, data visualizations, before/after metrics
**Messaging:** ROI-focused, direct, confident. Speaks to Head of Growth.
**Borrow:** Metrics as hero content. CTA urgency. Social proof blocks.
**Avoid:** Looking cheap or salesy. Fintech buyers are skeptical.

### Archetype 3 — "Enterprise Credibility Studio"
**Think:** Structured, trust-heavy, institutional feel. KPMG meets creative agency.
**Visual:** Structured grid, navy/white, logos, process diagrams
**Messaging:** Expertise-led. Talks about frameworks, regulatory awareness, industry depth.
**Borrow:** Credibility signals, compliance awareness messaging, B2B trust builders.
**Avoid:** Too corporate/stiff. Loses the modern fintech vibe.

### PROBLEM SECTION

**H2:** Generic Agencies Don't Get Fintech.

**Body:**
Most marketing agencies treat fintech like any other B2B SaaS. They don't understand FCA compliance. They've never written copy for a money transmitter. They can't tell a neobank from a core banking platform.

**Pain Points (3 columns):**
1. **"They got us flagged on Meta"**
   Compliance violations from agencies that don't understand financial advertising rules.

2. **"They wrote copy for a dentist. Then us."**
   Generic positioning that fails to differentiate your product in a crowded category.

3. **"They didn't know what LTV/CAC meant."**
   Agencies optimizing for clicks when you need qualified pipeline and unit economics.

**Bridge line:**
Grow Fintech is built differently. We speak fintech natively — because we only work with fintech.

### DIFFERENTIATORS SECTION

**H2:** Why Fintech Companies Choose Grow Fintech

**D1: We Only Do Fintech**
Not "fintech and healthcare and e-commerce." Fintech is the only industry we serve. That means deeper expertise, better results.

**D2: Compliance-Aware by Default**
Every campaign we build is reviewed against financial advertising regulations — FCA, SEC, CFPB. We protect your brand and your license.

**D3: We Think in Unit Economics**
We optimize for the metrics your CFO tracks — CAC, LTV, payback period — not vanity metrics that don't move your P&L.

**D4: Senior Team, Not Junior Grinders**
You work with senior strategists, not account managers. Every client gets direct access to the people doing the work.

### TESTIMONIALS SECTION

**H2:** What Our Clients Say

**Quote 1:**
"Grow Fintech is the only agency we've worked with that actually understood our compliance constraints from day one. No wasted cycles educating them on what we can and can't say."

**Quote 2:**
"We tripled our demo pipeline in one quarter. More importantly, the quality of leads improved — fewer tire-kickers, more serious buyers."
— *CMO, Digital Lending Startup*

**Quote 3:**
"The SEO content program they built for us is now our #1 acquisition channel. We rank for terms our competitors are still sleeping on."
— *Founder, Embedded Finance Platform*

### FAQ SECTION

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Do you work with early-stage fintechs or only growth-stage?**
Both. We work with seed-stage fintechs building their first marketing engine and Series B+ companies scaling into new markets. The engagement structure differs, but our fintech focus stays the same.

**Q2: How do you handle financial advertising compliance?**
Every campaign asset we produce is reviewed against applicable financial advertising regulations (FCA, SEC, CFPB, MAS depending on your market). We've never had a client campaign flagged for compliance violations.

**Q3: What's your typical engagement model?**
We work on monthly retainers for ongoing growth partnerships and project-based engagements for specific initiatives (GTM launches, landing page builds, audits). Minimum engagement is 3 months.

**Q4: Do you work with B2B fintechs, B2C, or both?**
Both. We have dedicated teams for B2B fintech (enterprise sales cycles, ABM, LinkedIn) and B2C fintech (performance marketing, lifecycle, retention). The strategies are very different — we don't mix them up.

**Q5: How quickly can you get started?**
We can typically onboard within 5–7 business days. Our Strategy Sprint in week one means you're seeing outputs before most agencies have finished their "kickoff deck."
