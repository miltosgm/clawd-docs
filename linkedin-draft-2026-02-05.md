## Topic: AEO Quick Win Most Brands Are Missing

---

Most brands are optimizing for Google.

ChatGPT is already delivering 100M+ search results per day.

If your content isn't structured for AI retrieval, you're invisible in the fastest-growing search channel.

Here's what we're seeing 👇

**The shift is happening fast:**
• ChatGPT search launched 6 months ago
• Perplexity grew 500%+ in traffic last year
• Google's AI Overviews now show on 60% of searches
• Traditional SEO alone isn't enough anymore

But here's what most people miss:

**You don't need to choose between SEO and AEO.**

The brands winning in 2026 are doing both. Here's the framework:

**1/ Entity optimization**
Make your brand, products, and expertise clearly defined. AI models need to understand WHO you are and WHAT you're authoritative on.

**2/ Structured answers**
FAQ schema, clear definitions, direct answers to common questions. AI wants to cite sources that make its job easy.

**3/ Semantic depth**
Cover topics comprehensively. AI pulls from content that demonstrates real expertise, not keyword-stuffed pages.

**4/ Citation-worthy content**
Original data, expert insights, unique frameworks. Give AI a reason to reference YOU instead of your competitors.

**The window is 6-12 months.**

Right now, most companies aren't optimizing for AI search at all. Early movers are building citation authority that will compound over time.

If traditional search was about being found, AI search is about being chosen.
